<h3>EDITH TRIES TO EXPLAIN.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I do think Edith is the queerest girl I ever saw
in all my life!&rdquo; said Marty Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't jump up and down behind my chair that
way, Marty,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;you shake
me so that I can scarcely hold my needle. What
does Edith do that is so queer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she's always putting ten into things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Putting ten into things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes'm. I mean when she gets any money
she always says ten will go into it so many
times, and then she takes a tenth of it&mdash;you
know we learn about tenths in fractions at
school&mdash;and goes and puts it in a blue box she
has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should call that taking ten out of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it is, that's what she does.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Every time she gets ten cents she puts one cent
in her blue box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she do if she only gets five
cents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she keeps it very carefully till she gets
another five, and then she takes her tenth out
of it. And would you believe it, when we were
all at Asbury Park last summer&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Marty,&rdquo; interrupted her mother, &ldquo;can't you
tell me just as well sitting still? You fidget so
that you make me dreadfully nervous. Can't
you sit still?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe I can, but I'll try real hard,&rdquo;
said Marty, crowding herself into Freddie's little
rocking-chair and clasping her arms around her
knees, as if to hold herself still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what about Asbury Park?&rdquo; Mrs. Ashford
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, when we were at Asbury Park and
Edith's father was going to New York, he gave
her a whole dollar to do what she pleased with.
Now you know it would be the easiest thing in
the world to spend a dollar there. I could spend
it just as easy as anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you could,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford,
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And any way you know it was vacation,
and even if you save tenths other times you
oughtn't to feel as if you must do it in vacation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
But Edith had to go and get her dollar changed
and put ten cents of it in the old blue box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she would not take a vacation from her
tenths?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. And the other day when her
uncle from Baltimore was here, he gave her fifty
cents, and it would just pay for a perfectly lovely
paintbox that she wants; but she couldn't buy
it because five cents of the fifty was tenths; and
now she'll have to wait till she gets some more
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she do with all the money in the
blue box?&rdquo; Mrs. Ashford inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she gives it to some mission-band!&rdquo; replied
Marty in a tone of disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the mission-band Miss Agnes Walsh
wanted you to join?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am; but I didn't want to take up
my Saturdays going to a thing like that, I'd
rather play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;what is
the name of that band?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Missionary Twigs</i>,&rdquo; replied Marty. &ldquo;Funny
kind of a name, isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then presently she said, &ldquo;I don't think
Edith always takes the tenths out fair; for when
her grandma was away lately for six days she
paid Edith three cents a day for watering her
plants, and of course that was eighteen cents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
So the tenth was a good deal over one cent and not
quite two, and yet Edith put two cents of it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that was more than fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it was,&rdquo; Marty admitted.
She actually sat quite still for two or three minutes
thinking, and then asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma&mdash;I never thought of this before
but what do you suppose is the reason she
saves <i>tenths</i>? Why doesn't she save ninths or
elevenths or something else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you ask her?&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; exclaimed Marty. &ldquo;I'll ask her the very
next time I go over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which was in about five minutes, for Edith lived
in the same block and the little girls were
constantly visiting each other. This being Saturday,
of course there was no school. Marty ran
in at the side gate and through the kitchen with
a &ldquo;How do, Mary?&rdquo; to the cook. Edith heard
her coming and called over the stairs,</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Marty, come right up! I was just wishing you
would come over and help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty flew up stairs and into the nursery.
Edith's dolls were sitting in a row on the little bureau, some
dressed and some undressed, and Edith was standing
in front of them looking very much perplexed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I'm so glad you've come,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Now you can help me with these troublesome
dolls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we've just heard that Aunt Julia and
Fanny are coming to tea this evening, and of
course I want the dolls to look decent. I
wouldn't have Fanny see them in their everyday
clothes for anything; and they don't seem
to have enough good clothes to go around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's see what they've got,&rdquo; said Marty, plunging
into business with her usual energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;Queenie has her new
white Swiss, so she's all right, and she can have
Virginia's surah sash. Louisa Alcott can wear
her black silk skirt and borrow Queenie's blue
cashmere waist. But Harriet has nothing fit for
an evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her wear the sailor suit she came in,
and say she's just home from the seaside,&rdquo; suggested
Marty, after a moment's meditation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will do,&rdquo; replied Edith. &ldquo;But
what about Virginia? Her white dress is soiled,
her red gauze is badly torn, and she can't borrow
from the others because she's so much
larger. To be sure she has this pale blue tea-gown
I made myself. Do you think it would be
good enough?&rdquo; and she held it up doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Marty candidly, &ldquo;I don't think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
it would. It isn't made very well. It's kind
of baggy. Hasn't she anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a brown woollen walking
dress and a Mother Hubbard wrapper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither of those will do,&rdquo; Marty decided.</p>

<p>Then she put her finger to her lip and
thought.</p>

<p>A bright idea occurred to her presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put her to bed and make believe she's
sick. She can wear the best nightdress, trimmed
with lace, and we can put on the ruffled
pillow-cases and fix up the bed real nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be splendid!&rdquo; cried Edith. &ldquo;I
knew you'd think of something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went to work on the plans proposed,
and soon had the whole family in presentable
condition. So busy were they with the dolls
that Marty would have forgotten the errand
she came on, had she not happened to catch a
glimpse of the blue box when Edith opened a
drawer. Then she exclaimed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Edie, what I came over for was to ask
you why you save tenths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I do what?&rdquo; said Edith, wondering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you put tenths away in your box.
Why don't you save eighths or ninths or
something else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the Bible says tenths,&rdquo; Edith replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bible!&rdquo; cried Marty. &ldquo;Does the Bible
say anything about saving tenths for a mission-band?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not just that; but it says&mdash;wait, I'll
get my Bible and show you what it does say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ran into her room, and bringing her
Bible, sat down on a low chair and eagerly
turned the leaves. Marty knelt close beside
her, bending over the book also, so that her
brown curls pressed against Edith's wavy golden
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here's one of the verses,&rdquo; said Edith.
&ldquo;Leviticus twenty-seventh chapter and thirtieth
verse: 'And all the tithe of the land,
whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit
of the tree, is the Lord's; it is holy unto the
Lord.'&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;There's nothing about tenths in that,&rdquo;
said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tithes means tenths&mdash;the tenth part,&rdquo;
Edith explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! does it? Well, you see, I didn't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; here it is in the thirty-second verse:
'And concerning the tithe of the herd or of
the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the
rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.'&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;But there's nothing in all that about money,&rdquo;
Marty objected. &ldquo;It's all fruit and flocks
and herds.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Edith replied, &ldquo;but mamma says
that flocks and herds and money are all different
kinds of property. The Jews hadn't much
money; their property was flocks and herds and
such things. Giving tenths of what they had
for the Lord's service was a very important
part of their religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are not a Jew,&rdquo; said Marty.
&ldquo;Besides, you give your tenths to a mission-band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the mission-band sends the money to a
big society that uses it to send people to tell the
heathen about God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that what mission-bands are for&mdash;to send
people to teach the heathen?&rdquo; asked Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to tell us about the heathen, so
that we shall want to send the gospel to them,&rdquo;
said Edith. &ldquo;Giving to help teach people about
God is giving to him, isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does the Bible say that everybody
must give tenths?&rdquo; asked Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;there is another plan in
the New Testament. Mamma says that it is
good for older people, but for little children
who haven't good judgment, the Jewish plan of
giving tenths is better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be pretty hard to have to give some
of your money away, whether you want to or
not,&rdquo; said Marty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! but I always want to,&rdquo; Edith declared.
&ldquo;The longer I do this way the better I like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Marty consolingly, &ldquo;a
tenth isn't much any way; you'd hardly miss
it. Neither would the Jews, for I guess they
were pretty rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! the tenth wasn't all they gave, and it
isn't all I give. For me it is just the&mdash;the&mdash;beginning,
the <i>sure</i> thing. The Jews had other
ways of giving&mdash;first-fruits and thank-offerings
and praise-offerings and free-will-offerings. And
sometimes I give thank-offerings and praise-offerings
too, but they are extra; the tenths I
give always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's all dreadfully mixed up,&rdquo; said poor
Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is, the way I tell it,&rdquo; Edith
candidly admitted. &ldquo;Let us go and get mamma
to tell you, the way she told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty willingly agreed, and they went into
the sitting-room where Mrs. Howell was sewing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>WHAT MRS. HOWELL TOLD THEM.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; cried Edith, &ldquo;I've been trying
to tell Marty about tenths and offerings, and
why I give my money that way, but I can't do
it so that she can understand. Wont you tell
her, and show her some of the verses you
showed me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Marty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Howell
pleasantly to the little girl who ran to kiss her.
&ldquo;What is it you don't understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't quite understand why the Jews
gave tenths, nor why Edith has to do what the
Jews did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, bring your Bible, Edith, and give
Marty mine, and I will show you some of the
passages about giving. The first mention in
the Bible of giving tithes to the Lord is when
Jacob was at Bethel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn't that when he slept on a stone pillow,
and had the beautiful dream of angels
going up and down a ladder that reached to
heaven?&rdquo; Edith asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and you remember the Lord appeared
to him in the dream, and promised to be with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
him wherever he went. And Jacob made a vow
to the Lord, in which he said, 'And of all that
thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth
unto thee.' You will find it all in the twenty-eighth
chapter of Genesis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marty, after turning the leaves a
few minutes. &ldquo;Here it is: I never noticed it
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Mrs. Howell went on, &ldquo;you know
when God brought the children of Israel out of
Egypt into the promised land, he gave them a
great many laws, for they were just like children,
and had to be told exactly what to do on
every occasion. Among other things he told
them how to give. Edith, find the eighteenth
chapter of Numbers and the twenty-first verse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edith found the place and read, &ldquo;And behold,
I have given the children of Levi all the
tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for the service
which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle
of the congregation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should the children of Levi have it?&rdquo;
asked Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the tribe of Levi was set apart for
the service of God in the tabernacle, and afterward
the temple, and had no 'inheritance' of
land to till and pasture flocks upon like the
other tribes; so the rest of the nation was instructed
to provide for them. So you see these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
tithes were for what we should call the support
of the gospel; and Levi was the ministering
tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Howell showed the children passages
in Second Chronicles and Nehemiah where
bringing tithes is spoken of, and in Malachi
where the people are rebuked for not bringing
them. Then she bade them turn to places in
the Gospels of Matthew and Luke where our
Saviour commends the giving of tithes, though
he says that there are &ldquo;weightier matters of the
law, judgment, mercy, and faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tithes were not all the Israelites gave,&rdquo;
Mrs. Howell resumed, after the little girls had
read the verses. &ldquo;They gave in many other
ways. Let me take that Bible a moment, Marty.
Here in Deuteronomy, twelfth chapter and sixth
verse, you see that many things are mentioned
besides tithes&mdash;vows and free-will-offerings and
the firstlings of the herds and of the flocks.
Then at their feast times, three times in the
year, they were told, in the sixteenth chapter of
the same book, the sixteenth and seventeenth
verses, that every man was to give as he was
able.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me they must have been giving
all the time,&rdquo; observed Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has been estimated that a truly devout
Jew gave away about a third of his income.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
That is more than three-tenths, you know. Giving
freely to the Lord's service and to the poor
was part of a Jew's religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's what Edith says,&rdquo; Marty remarked.
&ldquo;'Tisn't part of ours, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Howell, smiling a
little; &ldquo;though perhaps not as much as it should
be. All through the Bible we are taught the
duty of giving, and though, of course, those particular
directions in the Old Testament were
intended especially for the Jews, we may learn
from them that the best way of giving is to give
systematically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by systematically?&rdquo;
asked Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean not giving just when we happen
to feel particularly interested in some object,
or when we don't want the money for something
else, but having some plan about it and
giving regularly, intelligently, and, above all,
prayerfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Marty the New Testament plan for
giving, mamma,&rdquo; Edith requested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;St. Paul tells the Corinthians in the sixteenth
chapter and second verse of the first
epistle: 'Upon the first day of the week let
every one of you lay by him in store, as God
hath prospered him.' You see that is somewhat
different from tenths. No particular portion is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
mentioned, but we are to regularly set aside for
religious purposes as much as we can afford, and
the amount is to be increased as our means increase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why doesn't Edith do that way?&rdquo; Marty
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she is older and better able to judge
how much she ought to give, she may adopt that
plan. But it is simpler and easier just to give a
tenth, and it is well for little people who are
learning to have a plain and easy rule to go by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why does Edith give her tenths to
foreign missionary work instead of to something
else?&rdquo; asked Marty.</p>

<p>This led to a long talk about the duty of
obeying Christ's last command to carry the gospel
to all nations; and Mrs. Howell explained
how missionary societies are trying to obey this
command, and how important it is that Christians
should be very prompt and regular with
their contributions, so that the good work may
not be hindered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Howell, &ldquo;in order to
send the gospel to these far-away people, we
must send missionaries to them. There is no
other way, while there are a good many ways in
which even children may help people near by.
For instance, they can persuade other children
to go to church and Sunday-school. And then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they can be kind to the poor, and can help them
in other ways beside giving money to them.
Edith mends her old toys for poor children.
She keeps her bright cards and picture books
as nice as possible, and when done with them
carries them to the Children's Hospital or to
the Almshouse; and she is very careful of her
clothes, so that when she has outgrown them
they will do for poor little girls. There are
children now down town going to Sunday-school
in her clothes. So you see that even if your
money goes to the missionary work, you need
not neglect other ways of doing good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it's grand!&rdquo; said Marty with long-drawn
breath. &ldquo;I've a great mind to begin
trying to do somebody some good, and not keep
everything myself. I have a dime every week
to do what I please with, and sometimes I get
other money besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure you would find a great deal of
satisfaction in helping others,&rdquo; said Mrs. Howell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Howell,&rdquo; asked Marty, after studying
the verse in First Corinthians for some time,
&ldquo;what does it mean about laying by in store the
first day of the week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first day of the week is the Sabbath,
and that is a fitting time to consider how God
has prospered you and to lay aside your offering.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think if I had a box and saved tenths I'd
like to do that way,&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;I suppose
papa could give me my dime just as well Saturday
as Monday. I do believe I'd like to belong
to that band and give some money to send
Bibles and teachers to the heathen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do, do join our mission-band,&rdquo; urged
Edith. &ldquo;You'll like it ever so much,&rdquo; and she
went on so enthusiastically telling how delightful
it was, that Marty at once decided, if her
mamma approved, she would &ldquo;join&rdquo; at the very
next meeting. Of course she could not have
been so constantly with Edith without already
having heard much about the band, but she had
never been so interested in it as this morning,
and was now very anxious to go to the meeting
the coming Saturday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll run right home and ask mamma,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<h3>MARTY GETS STARTED.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;O Mamma!&rdquo; cried Marty, bursting into her
mother's room, &ldquo;may I have&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>Then she stopped suddenly, for she saw her
mother was sitting in the rocking-chair with
Freddie in her arms, evidently trying to put him
to sleep. He looked around when Marty came
in so noisily, and Mrs. Ashford said, in a vexed
tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Marty! why do you rush in that way? I
have been trying for half an hour to put Freddie
to sleep, and have just got him to lay his head
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I will lay my head up,&rdquo; Freddie announced,
and sat up with his eyes as wide
open as if he never meant to go to sleep in his
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm so sorry, mamma,&rdquo; said Marty, &ldquo;but
I didn't know he'd be going to sleep at this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is sooner than usual, but he seemed so
sleepy and was so fretful, I thought I would just
give him his dinner early, and put him to sleep
before our lunch.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will lie on the bed with me, and
go to sleep that way, as he did the other day,&rdquo;
suggested Marty, who was always very ready to
make amends for any mischief she had caused.
&ldquo;Wont Freddie come and lie down beside sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; said Freddie, shaking his curly
head and pushing Marty away with his foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you a pretty story,&rdquo; said Marty
coaxingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the little boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty story about the three bears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this mention of his favorite story Freddie
began to relent, and presently stretched out his
arms to Marty. Mrs. Ashford put him on the
bed, and he cuddled up to Marty while she told
him the thrilling story of the Great Huge Bear,
the Middle-sized Bear, and the Little Small Wee
Bear; but long before she came to the place
where little Silver Hair was found, Freddie was
fast asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you going to ask me, Marty?&rdquo;
inquired her mamma, when they were seated
at lunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Marty, in her excitement
laying down her fork and twisting her napkin.
&ldquo;I was going to ask you if I might have a box to
put tenths in, and if I mayn't belong to the
mission-band.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you didn't want to belong to the
band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn't before, but I do now. I
didn't know till this morning how nice it is.
Mrs. Howell and Edith have been telling me all
about giving money systematically, and showing
me verses in the Bible; and so I thought I'd like
to give some of my money, and go with Edith to
the mission meeting next Saturday, if you will
let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you may go if you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may I have a box to put my money
in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall I get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll give you one,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford, laughing.
&ldquo;Will that cardinal and gilt one of mine
be suitable for the purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you give me that beauty? Thank you
ever so much,&rdquo; and Marty flew around the table
to kiss her mother.</p>

<p>When they went up stairs Mrs. Ashford got
out the pretty box, and, at Marty's desire, wrote
on the bottom of it, &ldquo;Martha Ashford,&rdquo; and the
date. Marty, after excessively admiring and
rejoicing over it, made a place for it in the
corner of one of her drawers. Then she consulted
her mother how to begin with the tenths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't any of this week's money left,&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
she said&mdash;in fact she seldom had any of her
weekly allowance over&mdash;&ldquo; but I have twenty-seven
cents of my Christmas money yet. Had I
better take a tenth of that, or wait and begin
with my next ten cents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother thought it would be best, perhaps,
to keep the twenty-seven cents for &ldquo;emergencies,&rdquo;
and begin the tenths with the next
week's money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But one penny will be very little to take to
the meeting,&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;How would it do
to put in two more as a thank-offering for something
or other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a very good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the evening her father came in for his
share of the requests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;would you just as soon
give me my ten cents this evening as Monday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied, taking a dime out of
his pocket. &ldquo;What's going on this evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing's going on, but I've begun to
have a box for missionary money&mdash;that lovely
cardinal one of mamma's with gilt spots on it&mdash;and
I'm going to put tenths and offerings in it
and take them to the mission-band to help send
missionaries to the heathen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that's good. But what are you going
to do about candy and such things?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't put all my money in the box;
just some of it. I'm going to learn to give&mdash;what
was it I told you mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Systematically?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am, that's it. You know, papa, that
means giving just so much of your money and
giving it at a certain time and never forgetting
to give it. That's the reason I wanted my ten
cents now, so that I can put some of it in the
box to-morrow morning. And, O papa! would
it trouble you to give it to me all in pennies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said her father gravely, and he
counted out ten pennies, taking back the dime.
&ldquo;Now how much of that goes in the cardinal
box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One penny for tenths and two as a thank-offering,
because I'm thankful that I've got
started. So to-morrow morning three pennies
will rattle into the box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it's the first day of the week.
That's the New Testament plan, 'lay by in store
on the first day of the week.'&rdquo; </p>

<p>Then she climbed on her father's knee and
told him all her day's experience. He approved
of her plans and said he hoped she would be
able to carry them out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a very good thing for
small folks to learn to spend their money wisely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and a better thing to learn to be willing to share
the good they have with those not so well off.
But you will have to watch yourself very carefully,
for it wont be so easy to do all this when
the novelty wears off as it is now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I'm always going to do this way,&rdquo; said
Marty very determinedly, &ldquo;all my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She always entered with heart and soul into
whatever interested her, and all that week she
could hardly think of anything but the mission-band
and the money she was saving for it. By
Wednesday she had dropped two more pennies
into the box&mdash;a free-will-offering she told her
mother&mdash;and did not spend a cent for anything,
though one of her dolls was really suffering for
a pink sash.</p>

<p>She was a great deal of the time with Edith,
who gave her the most glowing accounts of
what they did at the band&mdash;how they had recitations
and dialogues and items, how they made
aprons and kettle-holders and sold them, and
how Miss Agnes read most interesting missionary
stories to them while they sewed. She also
told of a beautiful letter the secretary, Mary
Cresswell, had written to the lady missionary in
the school in Lahore, India, which the Twigs
supported, and how they were anxiously looking
for a reply. Miss Agnes said they must not
expect a reply very soon, for missionaries were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
very busy people and had not much time for
letter-writing. But the girls thought that Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash;, the missionary, would be so pleased with
Mary's letter she would certainly make time to
write, at least a tiny answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the band support a whole school?&rdquo;
Marty inquired in surprise. &ldquo;It must take a lot
of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we do is to pay the teacher's salary,
and that's only about twenty or twenty-five dollars
a year,&rdquo; Edith replied. &ldquo;You see it's this
kind of a school: the missionary ladies rent a
little room for a school and hire a native teacher,
somebody perhaps who attends one of the mission
churches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can any one afford to teach for so
little money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that's a good deal for them, for the
natives of those countries can live on very little,
Miss Agnes says. So the missionaries sometimes
have a good many of these schools in
different parts of the city, and they visit each
one every two or three days to see how the
children are getting on and to give them religious
instruction. Miss Agnes says in that way
the missionaries can do something for a great
many children, and the more money we bands
send to pay teachers the more of these little
schools there may be.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Marty could hardly wait for Saturday to
come. She asked her mother to select a verse
for her to say at the meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Edith says they all repeat verses when
their names are called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother chose this one for her: &ldquo;The
silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the
Lord of hosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<h3>WHOLES INSTEAD OF TENTHS.</h3>

<p>When Marty came home from the meeting
the next Saturday evening, and entered the
sitting-room in her usual whirlwind style, she
found her father there having a romp with
Freddie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here is little sister! Well, missy,
where have you been?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty reproachfully.
&ldquo;To the mission meeting, of course. I
told you this morning I was going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you did; and you have told me every
morning this week that this was the important
day. I don't know how I came to forget it.
Well, how did you like the meeting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ever so much! I heard a great many
sad things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's a new reason for liking a thing,&rdquo;
said her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; replied Marty, &ldquo;I liked it because
it was so nice and interesting, but I did hear
some sad things. Don't you think it's sad to
hear of a little school in one of those big, bad
Chinese cities, where the children were beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to learn about Jesus, being broken up because
the folks in this country don't send
money enough to pay a teacher? And it would
only take a little money, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is certainly very sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and Miss Agnes told us of other
schools that have to send the girls and boys
away because there isn't possibly room for
them, and there is no money to make the buildings
larger. I asked her why the big society in
this country&mdash;the one where the money from all
the bands is sent, you know&mdash;didn't just take
hold and build plenty of schools, so that all the
heathen children might be taught; and she said
that the Board&mdash;that's the big society&mdash;has no
money to send but what the churches and
Sunday-schools give them, and lately they
haven't been giving enough to build all the
schools that are wanted. Isn't it awful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very sad state of affairs,&rdquo; said Mr. Ashford,
but he could hardly help smiling a little
at Marty's profound indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think the people in this country
couldn't sit still and see things going on in
such a way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, do you know,
Miss Agnes says there are places where the
poor people are asking for missionaries, and
there are none to send, because there's not
money enough to support them. I should think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
that people would just go and take all their
money out of the banks and send it to the
Board. Then there would be so much money
pouring in that the Board would have to sit up
nights to count it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; that wouldn't do,&rdquo; said her father.
&ldquo;Little girls don't understand these matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but, papa,&rdquo; she said, coming close to
him, dragging her coat after her by one sleeve,
&ldquo;don't you think if everybody were to give as
the Lord has prospered them, there would be
nearly enough money to do the right thing by
the heathen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there's something in that,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Ashford, looking with a queer kind of a
smile at his wife, over Marty's head. &ldquo;But you
can't compel every one to do what is right. All
you can do is to attend to your own contributions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marty, half crying in her earnestness,
&ldquo;I started out to give tenths; but as
long as there are so many heathen, and so few
missionaries, I'm going to give halves or wholes.
I can't stand tenths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she marched off and put every cent she
had in the red box. When she got her weekly
allowance, that also went in. Her mother suggested
that she would better not give all her
money away at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it would be much better
to do as you started to do, and not give in
that impulsive way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Marty was sure she should not regret it,
and declared she was going to give every bit
of money she ever should have to send missionaries
to the heathen. She was very full of
ardor for about two days, though on Monday
something occurred that made her feel very
bad. She was playing with Freddie in the
morning, and when schooltime came he began
to whimper, and holding her dress, pleaded,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't go, Marty; play wis me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was very fond of her little brother, and
proud that he seemed to think more of her than
he did of any one else, so she was usually quite
gentle with him. She now petted him and
coaxed him to let her go, saying when she came
home she would bring him a pretty little sponge
cake. She often brought these tasty little cakes
to Freddie, and he considered them a great
treat. The prospect of one quite satisfied him,
and after many last kisses he let her go peaceably.</p>

<p>On the way home from school she stopped
at the bakery, and it was not until the cake was
selected and wrapped up that she remembered
she had no money. It was all in her missionary
box.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can't take it after all,&rdquo; she said regretfully.
&ldquo;I forgot I have no money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference at all,&rdquo; said the
kindly German woman, who knew Marty, as
Mrs. Ashford generally dealt at the shop: &ldquo;you
take it all the same, and bring the penny to-morrow&mdash;any
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, mamma wouldn't like me
to do that,&rdquo; answered Marty, hastening out to
hide her tears. She was so sorry for Freddie's
disappointment; and disappointed he was, for
he had a good memory and immediately asked
for his cake. Then there was a great crying
scene, for Marty cried as heartily as he did, and
their mamma had to comfort them both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, mamma,&rdquo; said Marty, when Freddie
had condescended to eat a piece of another
kind of cake and quiet was restored, &ldquo;I think,
after all, I'll not put <i>every</i> cent of my money in
the box, but will keep a little to buy things for
dear little Freddie&mdash;and you,&rdquo; giving her mother
a squeeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be best,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford. &ldquo;I
know you enjoy bringing us things sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was quite true. Marty was very generous,
and nothing pleased her more than to
bring home some modest dainty, such as her
small purse would buy, and share it with everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in the house, not forgetting Katie in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>But her penniless condition brought her a
harder time yet. The next day in school a
sudden recollection flashed upon her that nearly
took her breath away. She could hardly wait
until school was dismissed to race home to her
mother, to whom she managed to gasp,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma! next Friday is Cousin Alice's
birthday!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford calmly. &ldquo;What
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know that letter-rack of silver
cardboard that I have been making for her
birthday, and counted so on giving her, isn't
finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all ready but the ribbon, isn't it? It
wont take long to finish. I will make the bows
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the ribbon isn't bought yet, and I
haven't got a cent!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty despairingly.</p>

<p>There were two very strict rules in connection
with the money Marty received each week.
One was she was never to ask for it in advance,
and the other that she was not to borrow from
any one, expecting to pay when she got her
dime. If she spent all her money the first of
the week, she had to do without things, no matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
how badly she wanted them, till the next
allowance came in. This was to teach her
foresight and carefulness, her father said. Now
she had no money and no expectation of any
until Saturday, when the birthday would be
over. Of course there was all the money in the
red box, but she did not dream of touching that.
It was just as much missionary money as if it
was already in the hands of the Board that Miss
Agnes talked about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had any ribbon that would suit,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;I would give it to you; but I
haven't. Besides, for a present it would be
better to have new ribbon. How much would
it cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosa Stevenson paid eight cents a yard for
hers, and it takes a yard and a half&mdash;narrow ribbon,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will want twelve cents. I am
sorry I cannot lend you the money, but it is
against the rule, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am, I know,&rdquo; Marty replied sorrowfully.</p>

<p>She was sadly disappointed, as she had been
looking forward for several weeks to the time
when she should have the pleasure of presenting the
nicely-made letter-rack to her cousin.
She did not grudge the money she had devoted
to missions; she would like to have given much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
more if she could; but she began to see that
Edith's way of giving according to system was
the best. She was still very much interested
in the heathen, but they seemed a little farther
off than on Saturday, while Cousin Alice and
the letter-rack now absorbed most of her
thoughts. She stood dolefully gazing out the
window, not paying any attention to Freddie's
invitation to come and play cable cars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, cheer up!&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;We
will find some way out of the difficulty. You
try to think of some plan to get twelve cents,
and so will I. Between us we ought to devise
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty brightened up instantly and looked
eagerly at her mother, sure that relief was coming
immediately. &ldquo;What is your plan, mamma?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I didn't say I had one yet,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ashford, laughing. &ldquo;You must give me time
to think; and you must think yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all she would say then, and Marty
spent a very restless afternoon and evening
trying to think of some way to earn or save
that money, but could think of nothing that
would bring it in time for Friday. At bedtime
her mother inquired, &ldquo;Have you got a plan yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. I can't think of a thing,&rdquo; answered
Marty, nearly as doleful as ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like this plan?&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford.
&ldquo;I have some rags up in the storeroom
that I want picked over, the white separated
from the colored, and if you will do it to-morrow
afternoon, I will give you fifteen cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'll do it! I'll do it!&rdquo; cried Marty in
delight, kissing her mother. &ldquo;You're the best
mamma that ever was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not pleasant work, and will probably
take all your playtime,&rdquo; cautioned her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don't mind that,&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>So, although the next afternoon was remarkably
pleasant, and it would have been delightful
to be playing with her sled in the snow-heaped
little park near by, where the other girls were,
she very cheerfully spent it in the dull storeroom
with an old calico wrapper over her dress,
sorting rags. There were a good many to do&mdash;though
she candidly said she didn't think there
was more than fifteen cents' worth&mdash;and she got
pretty tired. Katie offered to help, but Marty
heroically refused, and earned her money fairly.</p>

<p>The letter-rack was completed in good time,
and presented. Cousin Alice said it was the
very prettiest of all her gifts, besides being extremely
useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Marty that evening, &ldquo;I believe
after all I'll go back to Edith's plan of
giving 'tenths' and 'offerings' to missions.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that would be the better way,&rdquo; said
her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I'm tired of the heathen or the
mission-band, or of giving, you know, but just
because&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; said her mother, as she
hesitated; &ldquo;you are just as much interested in
the matter as ever, but you now see that there
are more ways than one of doing good with
money, and that it is better to give systematically,
as Mrs. Howell says. Then you know
what you are doing, and I dare say, taking it all
in all, you will give more that way than by giving
a good deal one time and nothing at all
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I'll <i>never</i> come to the time when I
wont give anything,&rdquo; Marty declared emphatically.</p>

<p>And she then truly believed she never should.</p>

<h3>THE EBONY CHAIR.</h3>

<p>For a few weeks everything went smoothly.
Marty attended the meetings of the band, in
which she took great interest, and put two or
three pennies in her box every Sunday morning.
But there came a time when she began to find it
hard to give even that much. There seemed to
be so many little things she wanted, and it was
just the season of the year when she had very
few presents of money. She generally got some
on her birthday, in August, and again at Christmas;
but as she could not keep money very well,
that was soon spent, and during the latter part
of the winter she was very poor. Once or twice
nothing went in the box but the strict tenth, and
once she had a hard struggle with herself before
even that went in; in fact, she had a very bad
time altogether. It was all owing to a tiny
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O girls!&rdquo; exclaimed Hattie Green, one day
at recess, &ldquo;have you seen those lovely chairs in
Harrison's window?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What chairs?&rdquo; inquired the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, such lovely little dolls' chairs! Carved,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
you know, and with <i>beautiful</i> red cushions. I
came by there this morning, and that's the
reason I was late at school, I stopped so long
to look at those cunning chairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's all go home that way,&rdquo; suggested
Marty, &ldquo;and then we can see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Hattie.</p>

<p>So after school quite a crowd went around
by Harrison's toy-store to see the wonderful
chairs.</p>

<p>There they were, rather small, to be sure, but
ebony&mdash;at least they looked like ebony&mdash;and
crimson satin. The girls were in raptures with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are beauties!&rdquo; cried Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I should love to have one!&rdquo; said
Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how much they are,&rdquo; said Rosa
Stevenson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go in and ask, Rosa,&rdquo; said Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do, do,&rdquo; urged the others.</p>

<p>Rosa went, and came back with the information
that they were twelve cents apiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that isn't so much,&rdquo; said Edith. &ldquo;I
think I can afford to get one. I'll see when I
go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I have enough money to buy one,&rdquo;
said Rosa, &ldquo;but I never buy anything without
asking mamma about it first.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She'll let you get it,&rdquo; said Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you girls always have some money
saved up, and I never have,&rdquo; sighed Marty.
&ldquo;And I do want one of those chairs so badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Hattie, &ldquo;and I haven't any
money either, but I'm going to tease mamma
night and day till she gives me twelve cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no use to tease my mamma,&rdquo; said Marty.
&ldquo;If she wont let me do a thing, she wont,
and that's the end of it. But of course I'll tell
her about the chairs, and see what she says.
Maybe she'll let me have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as she reached home Marty gave her
mother a glowing description of the chairs, winding
up with,</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, O mamma! I do want one awfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have so many playthings already,
Marty,&rdquo; objected her mother. &ldquo;Just look at
those closet shelves! Besides, you got a complete
set of dolls' furniture Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know I don't <i>need</i> another chair at all,
but those red ones are so cunning, and one
would look so well mixed in among my blue
ones. I should <i>love</i> to have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry your mind is so set on it,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;for I dislike to have you disappointed,
but when you have so many playthings,
I really don't feel like giving you money, even
if it is only a trifle.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May I buy a chair if I have money enough
of my own?&rdquo; Marty asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;if you wish to spend your money
that way; but I would rather save it for something
else if I were you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty had no very clear idea where &ldquo;money
of her own&rdquo; was to come from just at that time,
but thought it possible the necessary amount
might appear before the chairs were all sold.</p>

<p>The next morning Rosa and Edith came to
school with money to buy chairs, and at recess
all their special friends went with them to Harrison's
to make the purchase. When Marty had
a nearer view of the chairs and handled them,
she was more anxious than ever to possess one.
This anxiety increased as the days passed and
the chairs gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>Nobody gave her any money and her mother
did not offer her any more &ldquo;paid&rdquo; work. She
was very, very sorry that she had spent all of
her allowance on Monday morning&mdash;at least all
but two cents and the one in the red box. That,
of course, she took with her to the meeting Saturday
afternoon.</p>

<p>Saturday evening she received her next
week's supply, and that, with the two cents she
had over, was exactly enough to get the longed-for
toy. But one cent was tenths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That just spoils the whole thing,&rdquo; she said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to herself. &ldquo;I might as well have none at all as
only eleven cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she wondered if it would not do to borrow
that tenth. She had not thought of taking
out any of the money when she was in such
straits about Cousin Alice's ribbon, but this
seemed different. It was only one penny, and
she was sure of being able to replace it.</p>

<p>But borrowing was against the rule, and it
must be especially wrong to borrow missionary
money. She felt ashamed and her cheeks
burned when the thought came to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s'pose I'll have to give up the chair,&rdquo; she
sighed; &ldquo;at least unless I get a little more
money somehow. I wish papa wasn't so strict
about borrowing. A penny wouldn't be much
to borrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sunday morning she took out her money and
counted it over again very carefully. Yes, there
was exactly twelve cents. Then she slowly took
up one cent to drop in the box. As she did
so the temptation to borrow it came again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wont do that,&rdquo; she said resolutely, but
after looking at the penny for a while, concluded
not to put it in the box until after she came from
Sunday-school.</p>

<p>After Sunday-school she tried it again, but
still hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll wait till bedtime,&rdquo; she thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>By bedtime she had decided not to put it in
at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I b'lieve I'll borrow it. It wont do any
harm to let the box go empty for one week. I'll
get the chair to-morrow, and make the tenth all
right next Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she got into bed and covered herself up,
but she could not go to sleep. She tossed and
tumbled for what seemed to her a long time.
&ldquo;It's all because that penny isn't in the box,&rdquo;
she thought. Finally she could stand it no
longer. She got up, and feeling around in the
drawer, found the penny and put it in the box.
Then she went to bed, and was soon asleep.</p>

<p>Having decided she could not have what she
so ardently desired, Marty should have kept out
of the way of temptation, but every day she went
to look at the chairs, and seeing them, she
continued to want one. By Thursday they were
all gone but two, and Hattie triumphantly announced
that at last her mamma had given her
money to buy one. Then Marty felt that she
<i>must</i> have the other.</p>

<p>When she had her wraps on that afternoon
ready to go out to play, she went to the missionary
box, and, with hands trembling in her
excitement, took out the solitary penny. Then
without stopping to think she ran down stairs.
Just as she was opening the street-door she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
repented, and after meditating a while in the
vestibule, standing first on one foot and then on
the other, she slowly retraced her steps and put
the penny back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it's safe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll just dash
out without it, and of course when I haven't got
it, I can't spend it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dashed about half way, when all at once
the vision of the lovely chair rose up before her,
and the desire to possess it was greater than
ever. She stopped again to think, and the result
was, she returned and got the penny&mdash;it was not
quite so hard to take it out the second time as it
was the first&mdash;and started for the street once
more.</p>

<p>Perhaps she might have repented and gone
back again, had not her mother, who was entertaining
some ladies in the parlor, called to her,
&ldquo;Marty, don't race up and down stairs so,&rdquo; and
then Marty went out with the penny in her
hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE EMPTY BOX.</h3>

<p>So the chair was bought and Marty tried to
think she was perfectly satisfied, but it was
strange how little she cared for it after all. She
showed her purchase to her mother, who said it
was quite pretty, but not very substantial; that
she feared it would not last long.</p>

<p>Marty put it in her dolls' house and played
with it, trying hard to enjoy it, but her conscience
was so ill at ease that she soon began to
hate the sight of the chair, and by Friday evening
she had pushed it away back on the shelf
behind everything. The sight of the red box,
too, was more than she could stand, it seemed
to look so reproachfully at her; even after she
had laid one of her white aprons over it she disliked
to open the drawer.</p>

<p>There was a special meeting of the band that
Saturday, as they were getting ready for their
anniversary. No contributions were expected,
so that it did not matter about Marty having no
money; but she was feeling so low-spirited and
ashamed that she simply could not go among
the others nor take part in missionary exercises.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going for Edith this afternoon or
is she coming for you?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not going to the meeting,&rdquo; replied
Marty in a low voice. &ldquo;I told Edith I wasn't
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not going!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Ashford in
surprise. &ldquo;Why, you are not tired of it already,
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; Marty answered, &ldquo;but I don't
want to go to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford thought perhaps Marty and
Edith had had a little falling out, though it
must be said they very seldom quarreled; or
that Marty was beginning to tire a little of her
new enterprise, for she was rather in the habit
of taking things up with great energy and soon
becoming weary of them. Mrs. Ashford had
not expected her missionary enthusiasm to last
very long; and as she herself was not at that
time much interested in such matters, she was
not prepared to keep up Marty's zeal, but was
inclined to allow her to go on with the work or
give it up, just as she chose, as she did in matters
of less importance.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Ashford knew that, whatever
the trouble was, it would all come out sooner or
later, for Marty always told her everything. So
she merely said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as it is so bleak to-day and you have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
cold, perhaps it would be just as well for you not
to go out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty, disinclined to play, took one of her
&ldquo;Bessie Books&rdquo; and sat down by the window.
Though so cheerless out-doors, with the wind
whistling among the leafless trees and blowing
the dust about, that sitting room was certainly
very cosey and pleasant.</p>

<p>Marty's &ldquo;pretty mamma,&rdquo; as she often called
her, in her becoming afternoon gown of soft,
dark red stuff, sat in a low rocker in front of the
bright fire busy with her embroidery and softly
singing as she worked. Freddie, on the rug at
her feet, played quietly with a string of buttons.
The only sounds in the room were Mrs. Ashford's
murmured song and an occasional chirp
from the canary. But all at once this cheerful
quietness was broken by loud sobbing.</p>

<p>Poor Marty had been so unhappy the last
two days, and now added to what she felt to be
the meanness of appropriating that missionary
penny, was the disappointment of not being at
the meeting, for she was longing to be there,
though not feeling fit to go. Besides, it was a
great load on her mind that she had not told her
mamma how she got the chair, nor what was the
reason she did not want to go to the meeting.
And now she could endure her wretchedness no
longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter, Marty?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Ashford, much startled. &ldquo;Are you ill? Is your
throat sore? Come here and tell me what ails
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma, I'm very, very wicked,&rdquo;
sobbed Marty, and running to her mother's
arms she tried to tell her troubles, but cried so
that she could not be understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, never mind,&rdquo; said her mother
soothingly. &ldquo;Wait until you can stop crying
and then tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Freddie was dreadfully distressed to see his
sister in such a state and did all he could to
comfort her, bringing her his horse-reins and a
whole lapful of building-blocks, and was rather
surprised that they did not have the desired
effect.</p>

<p>When Marty became quieter she told the
whole story of the dolls' chair and the missionary
penny. &ldquo;That's the reason I didn't want
to go to the meeting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don't feel
fit to 'sociate with good missionary children.
I'm so sorry and so ashamed. I wish I had let
the penny stay in the box and the chair stay in
the store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot undo what is done,&rdquo; said her
mother gravely. &ldquo;We can only make all possible
amends and try to do better in future. You
can replace the penny this evening, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
lesson you have had may teach you to be more
self-denying. You know you cannot spend all
your money for trifles and yet have some to give
away. If you want to give you must learn to do
without some things. But, Marty, if it is going
to be so difficult to devote some of your money
to missions, you had better just give up the
attempt and go back to your old way of doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty earnestly.
&ldquo;Please let me try again. I know I'll do better
now, and I do want to help in missionary work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;just as you wish.
I don't like to see you beginning things and
giving them up so soon, but at the same time I
don't think you need feel obliged to give to
these things whether you want to or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I do want to ever so much,&rdquo; Marty
protested.</p>

<p>She felt better after telling her mother all
about the matter, and now was quite ready to
brighten up and start afresh. The next morning
besides dropping in two pennies for tenths
she put in another, which she said was a
&ldquo;sorry&rdquo; offering, but did not know the Bible
name for it. She would have liked to make
amends by putting in the whole ten cents, but
her mother would not allow it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things would soon be as bad as ever,&rdquo; were
her warning words, &ldquo;if that's the way you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
going to do. The next thing you will want to
take some of it out, as you did the penny for the
chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, mamma! I don't b'lieve I ever <i>could</i>
be so mean again,&rdquo; Marty declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe either that you would do it
again. But you will certainly save yourself a
great deal of worry, and will be likely to do
more good in the work you have begun, by following
Mrs. Howell's advice of having a plan of
giving and keeping to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'm going to try that way in real
earnest now,&rdquo; said Marty; &ldquo;but I wish it was as
easy for me to be steady about things as it is
for Edith. She never seems to get into trouble
over her tenths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few days after this, when she was spending
the afternoon with Edith, Marty told Mrs. Howell
what a time she had had, and added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't it seem strange that I can't give
my money regularly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Howell, &ldquo;you
have not asked God to help you in your new
enterprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, I haven't,&rdquo; replied Marty. &ldquo;I
never thought of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child, we are nothing in our own
strength. We should always ask God to help
us, in what we attempt, and ask for his blessing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Unless he blesses our work, it cannot prosper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don't know how to ask him,&rdquo; said
Marty, speaking softly. &ldquo;The prayers I say
every night are 'Our Father,' and 'Now I lay
me,' and there's nothing in them about mission
work. I should have to say another prayer,
shouldn't I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you more fully understood the Lord's
Prayer, you would know that exactly what you
want is included in it. But why cannot you ask
for what you desire in your own words? Just go
to God as trustingly as you would to your mother,
when you want something you know she
will let you have, if it is good for you to have it.
And that would be really praying, for, Marty,
don't you know there's a great difference between
saying prayers and praying? You may
say a dozen prayers and not pray at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't I pray when I kneel beside the bed
and say those two prayers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do if you make the petitions your own,
and really desire what you ask for, and if you
ask in the right spirit. But if you just say the
words over without thinking what you are saying,
or whom you are speaking to, it is not
praying at all. It is mocking God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I wouldn't do that,&rdquo; said Marty,
looking frightened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you would not willfully, my dear,
but I just want to show you that saying over
certain words is not praying. We don't realize
what a blessed privilege it is to pray. God's ear
is open night and day to any of us, even the
smallest child. He is as ready to hear anything
you may have to say as he is to hear Dr. Edgar
when he gets up in his pulpit and prays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it wouldn't be wrong to ask God to
help me give missionary money regularly, would
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be very right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night when Marty knelt beside her bed
she really prayed. She felt that God was listening
to her, and when she came to the words,
&ldquo;Now I lay me down to sleep,&rdquo; she realized that
she was committing herself to his care, and was
sure that in that care she was safe. After her
usual prayers she paused a moment and then
added, &ldquo;And, O Lord, please help me to be
steady in giving missionary money.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>HOW MISSIONS HELPED THE HOME FOLKS.</h3>

<p>The mission work that Marty had entered
upon was teaching her to pray.</p>

<p>She really wished to be a mission worker in
her small way and she tried hard to be faithful,
but owing to her forgetfulness or impatience
or selfishness, things sometimes went wrong.
Once or twice she forgot to learn a verse to say
at the meeting, and was much mortified. Once
she got very impatient with a piece of sewing
and spoiled it, and then was angry because some
of the girls laughed at her. And she still found
it hard to give her money regularly; some
weeks she wanted it so much for something
else.</p>

<p>But all these little trials she carried to God
and was helped. This led to the habit of bringing
all her little troubles to him.</p>

<p>One day Miss Agnes remarked that we don't
put enough thanks in our prayers. We ask that
such and such things may be done, but we don't
thank God half enough for what he has done
and is constantly doing for us. We come to
him with all the miseries of our lives, but don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
tell him about the happy and joyous things.
Afterward Marty put more thanks in her prayers,
and she told Miss Agnes that it was astonishing
how many thankful things there were
to say.</p>

<p>Marty also used her Bible a great deal more
after she joined the band than before.</p>

<p>Besides the verse they were expected to
repeat at roll-call, Miss Agnes sometimes asked
them to bring all the texts they could find bearing
upon a certain subject. The golden text
for Sunday-school might be learned from the
lesson-paper, but it was necessary to search the
Bible for these other verses. At first Marty did
not know how to begin to find them and appealed
to her mother for help. Mrs. Ashford
gave all the assistance in her power, though
saying with a half-sigh,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid I don't know much about these
things, Marty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Ashford had been out shopping
and in the evening several parcels were
sent home. These she opened in the sitting-room.
As she unwrapped quite a large one
Mr. Ashford inquired,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that huge book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When his wife handed it to him he whistled
and exclaimed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;A concordance! What in the world do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
want with this? Are you going to study theology?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Ashford, laughing, &ldquo;but
Marty comes to me with so many questions that
I found I could not get on any longer without
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's a concordance, mamma?&rdquo; asked
Marty, &ldquo;and has it anything to do with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a book to help us find all those verses
in the Bible you have been asking me about.
You see I'm not as good and wise as your friend
Mrs. Howell, and don't know as much about
the Bible as she does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're every bit as good,&rdquo; declared Marty,
who by this time had got both arms around her
mother's waist as she stood on the rug, and was
looking up in her face lovingly, &ldquo;and you will
be as wise when you are as old, for she is a
great deal older than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father and mother both laughed at
Marty's earnestness, and Mr. Ashford said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's right, Marty. Stand up for your
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found the concordance very useful, and
from time to time spent many happy hours
searching the Scriptures with its aid, comparing
passages and talking them over. Not only did
they find texts for the band, but other subjects
were traced through the sacred pages. Occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Marty saw her mother busy with the
concordance and Bible when she had not asked
her assistance about verses.</p>

<p>It was while Marty was giving wholes instead
of tenths and the red box was so well
filled, that it met with an accident that disfigured
it for life. Though the occurrence was a
sad and humiliating one for Marty, it led to
good results.</p>

<p>She had the box out one day and was counting
the money, although she knew precisely
how much there was. As a good deal of it was
in pennies it made quite a noise, so that Freddie,
attracted by the bright outside and noisy inside,
thought he would like to have the box to play
with. He asked Marty to give it to him, but
she, busy with her counting, answered rather
sharply,</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; you can't have it. Go away,
now. Don't touch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Freddie was very quick in his movements,
and before she could get it out of his
reach he had seized it and shaken the contents
all over the floor. Marty, very angry at having
her beautiful box treated so roughly, and seeing
the money rolling about in all directions, cried
in loud tones,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go, you naughty boy! You'll break
it!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Freddie, now angry also, and determined to
have what he wanted, held on manfully, screaming,
&ldquo;Dive it to me! dive it to me!&rdquo; and in the
struggle a small piece was broken off the lid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford, hearing the loud tones, hurried
into the room, and arrived in time to see Marty
strike Freddie with one hand while she held
the box high above her head with the other.
Freddie was pounding her with all his little
strength and crying uproariously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marty, Marty!&rdquo; called Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;don't
strike your little brother. What is the matter?
Come here, Freddie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Freddie stamped his foot and screamed,
&ldquo;Will have it! Will have pretty box!&rdquo; and
Marty wailed, &ldquo;Oh! he's broken my lovely box
and spilled all my money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was some time before peace was fully restored,
though Marty was soon very repentant
for what she had done and Freddie's ill-temper
never lasted very long. After standing a while
with his face to the wall, as was his custom on
such occasions, crying loudly, the little tempest
was all over. He turned around, and putting
up his hands to wipe his eyes said pitifully,</p>

<p>&ldquo;My teeks are so wet, and I have no hamititch
to dry them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here and I'll dry them,&rdquo; said his
mother, taking him on her knee.</p>

<span class="caption">Mrs. Ashford, hearing the loud tones, hurried
into the room. Page 58</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
&ldquo;My chin is all wet,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is, but we'll dry all your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my hands are all wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a poor little wet boy!&rdquo; said his mother
tenderly, but cheerfully too.</p>

<p>After making him comfortable she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now are you sorry you were such a naughty
boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded his head, and turning to Marty,
who was crawling around gathering up her
money, he said, &ldquo;Sorry, Marty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty crept up to him, and kissing over and
over the little arm she had struck, said with eyes
full of tears,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dear little darling, you don't know
how awfully sorry Marty is for being so bad to
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they rubbed their curly heads together
until Freddie began to laugh, and in a few moments
he was playing with his tin horse as
merrily as if nothing had happened, while
Marty gathered up and put away her treasures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Marty,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;you must
keep that out of Freddie's sight. He is nothing
but a baby, and doesn't know that it is any
different from any other box. Let me see
where it is broken. Perhaps I can mend it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mamma,&rdquo; said Marty, &ldquo;I don't want it
mended. I am going to let it be this way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
remind me of how naughty I was to my dear
little brother, and maybe it will keep me from
getting so angry with him again. It does seem
dreadful, too, to think that just when I'm trying
to be good to children away over the sea, I
should be partic'lerly bad to my own little
brother, doesn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sha'n't say a word,&rdquo; replied her mother,
&ldquo;for I see you can rebuke yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the broken missionary box was a constant
reminder to Marty that her work for those far away
should make her all the more loving to the dear ones
at home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<h3>&ldquo;NOT IN THE GOOD TIMES.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>One Saturday afternoon as Edith and Marty
entered the room where the meetings of the
band were held, half a dozen girls rushed to
them, exclaiming,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what do you think! Mary Cresswell
has a letter from Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How eager they all were to hear that letter!
As soon as the opening exercises were over,
Miss Walsh told Mary she might read it. The
young secretary looked quite proud and important
as she unfolded the letter, very tenderly,
indeed, for it was written on thin paper, as
foreign letters are, and she was afraid of tearing
it.</p>

<p>After speaking very nicely of the letter she
had received from them, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; went on to
tell them something about Lahore and about the
school they were interested in. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not imagine a well-arranged
schoolroom with desks, maps, black-boards, and
so on. We cannot afford anything like that, and
in any case it would be useless to the kind of
pupils we have. We pay a woman a little for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the use of part of the room in which she lives,
and while the school is in session she goes on
with her work in one corner. This room is quite
dark, as, having no windows, all the light it
receives is from the door. It has no furniture
to speak of. The teacher and pupils sit on the
earth floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then described the dress of the little
girls, which certainly did not appear to be very
comfortable for the cool weather they sometimes
have in North India, and said, &ldquo;No matter how
poor and scanty the clothing, they must have
some kind of jewelry, even if it is only glass or
brass bangles. They are anything but cleanly,
as they are not taught in their own homes to be
so; besides, some of their customs are considerably
against cleanliness. For instance, they must
not wash themselves at all for a certain length
of time after the death of relatives. So it sometimes
happens the children come to school in a
very dirty condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These children, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; said, were bright
and learned quite readily. She mentioned some
of the hymns and Scripture verses they knew,
and some of the answers they had given to questions
she put to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the great difficulty is,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;they
are taken away from school so young to be married
and thus lost to us. Still it is good to think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that they receive some religious instruction, and
matters in regard to girls and women in India
are gradually improving. Not quite so much
stress is laid on child-marriage; indeed, some
native societies are being formed for the purpose
of opposing this custom, and many more
girls are allowed to attend school than used to
be the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is room yet for great improvement.
You, my young friends, in your happy
childhood and girlhood, cannot conceive the
miseries of these poor little creatures. Thank
God your lot is cast in a Christian land, and oh!
do all you can to send the gospel light into these
dark places of the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls had a great deal to say about this
letter, and as it was sewing afternoon, Miss
Walsh allowed them to talk over their work
instead of having any reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me,&rdquo; said little Daisy Roberts,
&ldquo;that in India they don't care as much
about girls as boys, and sometimes they kill the
girl babies. Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Miss Walsh. &ldquo;It used to be
a very common custom, and is still so to some
extent, though the British Government has done
much to stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be very cruel to want to kill
their own dear little babies. Why, if anybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
should hurt our little Nellie, we'd all fly at him
and nearly tear him to pieces,&rdquo; and Daisy's face
got very red and she doubled up her little fist at
the very thought of such a thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't always, nor perhaps often, done in
a spirit of cruelty. Sometimes it is because the
parents are poor and cannot afford to marry
their daughters, for weddings cost a great deal,
and according to the notions of the country
everybody must be married. Often it ruins a
man to get his daughters married, and he lives
in poverty all the rest of his life. Then very
ignorant and superstitious parents sometimes
sacrifice their children to please their gods, and
as girls are not as much thought of as boys, it is
frequently the girls who are killed. But, as I
told you, the Government does not allow such
doings, and when people are found breaking the
law they are punished. Besides, as Christianity
spreads these wicked things cease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that way they have of making little
girls get married is awful,&rdquo; said Edith. &ldquo;Just
think of being dragged off to be married when
you're only a little mite of a thing, and having
to leave your own mamma and live with a cross
old mother-in-law who abuses you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't their fathers and mothers love them
at all, Miss Agnes, that they send them off that
way and allow them to be miserable?&rdquo; asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Marty, who was ready to cry over the miseries
of the poor little India girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there are many cruel parents&mdash;heathenism,
you know, does not teach people to
be kind and loving&mdash;but many love their children
as much as your parents love you. In fact
they are over-indulgent to them, and let them
do just what they please when they are small.
And you may imagine that the mother especially
has a very sore heart when her little
daughter is taken from her and when she hears
of her being ill-treated in her new home. But
it is considered a disgrace if girls are not
married when mere children; and a loving
mother wishes to keep her daughters from disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how if the little girl's husband dies?&rdquo;
Rosa Stevenson inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then the poor little widow leads a miserable
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how?&rdquo; Marty asked. &ldquo;Can't she go
back home then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miss Walsh answered. &ldquo;She has to
live on in the father-in-law's house, where she is
treated shamefully, made to do hard work, is
half starved, and not allowed clothes enough to
keep her comfortable. She is not taken care of
when sick, and is treated worse in every way
than you have any idea of or ever can have.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It's perfectly dreadful!&rdquo; declared one of the
girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't they use to burn the widows on
their husbands' funeral pile?&rdquo; asked another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the British Government put a stop
to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I'd rather be burnt up and done
with it than have to lead such a miserable life,&rdquo;
said Mary Cresswell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it would be dreadful to be burnt,&rdquo;
said Rosa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me it's dreadful all around,&rdquo; said
Marty, sighing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be thankful you don't have to
make the choice,&rdquo; said Miss Walsh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the poor children are not even made
comfortable when they go to school,&rdquo; Rosa went
on, &ldquo;so dirty and forlorn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How queerly they're dressed,&rdquo; said Hannah
Morton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seem to be dressed principally in earrings
and bracelets,&rdquo; remarked Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Agnes,&rdquo; inquired Mary, &ldquo;aren't there
other kinds of schools besides these little day-schools?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. One of the first things that the
missionaries try to do is to establish boarding-schools,
so as to get the boys and girls altogether
away from the influence of their heathen homes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
This is the way many converts are made. There
are now many such schools and much good has
been done by them. You remember we sent the
extra ten dollars we had last year to help build
an addition to a boarding-school in China.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are Chinese little girls treated as badly as
the ones in India?&rdquo; Marty asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Hannah, before Miss Walsh
could reply. &ldquo;Don't you remember the 'Chinese
Slave Girl,' that Miss Agnes read to us?&mdash;at
least read some of it. And don't you know
how they are tortured by binding their feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn't done on <i>purpose</i> to torture them,&rdquo;
said Mary. &ldquo;That's a custom of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of their customs appear to be tortures,&rdquo;
said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Walsh, &ldquo;the customs of
barbarous and half-civilized nations are very
hard on the women and girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it all makes me feel very sorrowful,&rdquo;
Marty declared. &ldquo;I never thought before, when
I've had such good times all my life, that there
are so many little girls who are not&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the good times?&rdquo; said Miss Walsh,
helping her out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am; and I do wish I could do something
for some of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said several of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; suggested Edith, &ldquo;the faster we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
send the gospel to those countries the better it
will be for the girls and everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn't we raise more money this year,
enough to support another school, or to pay for
a girl or boy in a boarding-school somewhere?&rdquo;
Rosa proposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case we should have to double, or
more than double, our usual amount,&rdquo; said Miss
Walsh. &ldquo;The question is, can we do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let us try!&rdquo; exclaimed several of the
girls.</p>

<p>Then they began forthwith to make plans for
raising more money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the more members we have, the
more money we'll raise,&rdquo; said Mary Cresswell,
&ldquo;so I think we'd better try again to get others
to join our band. I have asked the Patterson
girls two or three times, but I'm going to ask
them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not ask them <i>plump</i> to join,&rdquo; suggested
Bertie Lee. &ldquo;Just get them somehow to
come to one meeting, and then they'll be sure to
want to belong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's some wisdom in that,&rdquo; said Miss
Walsh, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; said Bertie, &ldquo;and I believe I'll try
that way with Annie Kelley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to ask that new girl in our Sunday-school
class,&rdquo; said Hannah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to try to get <i>somebody</i> to come,&rdquo;
said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; cried the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; said Miss Walsh. &ldquo;We want
to get as many people as possible interested in
missionary work, and, as Mary says, the more
that are interested and belong to societies, the
more money will be raised, and, of course, the
more good will be done. So, don't you see, you
are aiding the cause very much when you try to
make our meetings attractive, and so induce
others to join the band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've thought of a way to make some missionary
money, if it would be right to do it,&rdquo; said
Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Miss Walsh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you know those prizes Dr. Edgar
and Mr. Stevenson give at the Sunday-school
anniversary for learning the Psalms and chapters&mdash;would
it do to ask them to give us money
instead of books or anything else, so that we
might have it for missions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We certainly might ask our pastor and superintendent
what they think of the plan. I
have no doubt they would be willing to adopt
it when they know what the money is to be used
for. I think myself, your idea is a very good
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rosa, &ldquo;we should not only be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
studying the Bible for our own sakes, but be
helping missions at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'd be working for our missionary money
then, shouldn't we?&rdquo; remarked one of the
girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>indeed</i>!&rdquo; replied another, with a laugh
and shrug. She was not fond of committing to
memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a good way, though,&rdquo; said Marty, standing
up for Edith's suggestion, &ldquo;and I'm going
to start right in and learn something. Miss
Agnes, I wonder how much they'd give for the
119th Psalm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty asked this in real earnest, and although
Miss Walsh felt like smiling, she answered
gravely,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think it is quite the right spirit in
which to study the Bible, Marty&mdash;doing it only
for the sake of the money, even if the money
is for missions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I shouldn't do it <i>just</i> for the money,
but I thought if I could get more for a long
Psalm than for a short one, I'd rather learn
the long one, and have more missionary money.
But I shouldn't want to do it if it was
wrong, you know,&rdquo; Marty added, looking distressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you would not,&rdquo; said Miss Walsh
kindly. &ldquo;I have no doubt your motives are all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
right, though you can hardly explain them. I
can understand that you would be willing to do
considerable hard work for missions, and I am
glad of your willingness and enthusiasm. They
help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Marty looked radiant.</p>

<p>There were other plans proposed, and every
one had so much to say that Miss Walsh had
some trouble in getting the meeting to break
up.</p>

<h3>JENNIE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I do b'lieve,&rdquo; said Marty one day, after she
had been a member of the mission-band for
several months, &ldquo;I do b'lieve that hearing so
much about the poor little children in India
and China and those places, and trying to do
something to help them, makes me feel far
more like helping poor children here at home.
Now, there's Jennie&mdash;I know I shouldn't have
thought much about her if I hadn't been thinking
of those far-away children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was after she had made some sacrifices
for the benefit of poor little Jennie, and this is
the way she first came to know of her.</p>

<p>When the spring house-cleaning was going
on, Mrs. Ashford's regular helper one day could
not come and sent another woman. In the
evening when Mrs. Ashford went into the
kitchen to pay this Mrs. Scott for her day's
work, Marty, who had a great habit of following
her mother around the house, went also. Mrs.
Scott had just finished her supper, and after
receiving her money and replying to Mrs. Ashford's
pleasant remarks, she said hesitatingly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
pointing to a saucer of very fine canned peaches
which was part of her supper, but which she had
apparently only tasted, &ldquo;Please, mem, may
I take them splendid peaches home to my sick
little girl? She can't eat nothin' at all hardly,
and she would relish them, I know. If you'd jist
give me the loan of an old bowl or somethin&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! have you a sick child?&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford
sympathizingly. &ldquo;She shall certainly have
some peaches, but you must eat those yourself.
Katie, get&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, mem,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Scott, &ldquo;that's
too much like beggin'. I jist wanted to take
mine to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it isn't begging at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford.
&ldquo;I'm very glad you told me about your
little girl. Katie, fill one of those small jars
with peaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Ashford went into the pantry, and
returning with two large oranges and some
Albert biscuit, asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you carry these also?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott was full of thanks, and said she
knew such nice things would do Jennie a world
of good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can make enough to keep her warm in
winter and get her plain vittles, but it isn't at
all what she ought to have now, I know,&rdquo; she
said sorrowfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford asked what was the matter
with Jennie and how long she had been ill.
Mrs. Scott replied that she had hurt her back
more than a year ago; and though she had been
&ldquo;doctored&rdquo; then and appeared to get a little
better, since they moved to their present abode&mdash;for
they came from a distant town&mdash;she had become
worse and was now not able to walk at all,
but was obliged to lie in bed, sometimes suffering
much pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was she hurt?&rdquo; Mrs. Ashford inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She fell down the stair,&rdquo; was all the reply
given, but Katie said afterward that she had
heard that Jennie was thrown or pushed down
stairs by her drunken father. She said poor
Mrs. Scott had had a very hard life with this
shiftless, drunken husband, who abused her and
the children. All the children were dead now
except Jennie, who was about a year older than
Marty, and early in the winter &ldquo;old Scott,&rdquo; as
Katie called him, died himself from the effects
of a hurt received in a fight while &ldquo;on a spree.&rdquo;
As Mrs. Scott had been ill part of the winter
and unable to work much, she had got behind
with her rent, and altogether had been having
a very hard time.</p>

<p>Marty was very much interested in what
Mrs. Scott said, and asked a question or two on
her own account.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who stays with your little girl when you
are away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your sweet eyes! nobody stays with
her. She just lies there her lone self, unless
some of the other children in the house run in
and out, but mostly she doesn't want their
noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long has she been in bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the time for eight months, miss,&rdquo;
replied the poor mother with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't she ever sit up in the rocking-chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no rocking-chair, but sometimes
when I go home from work, or the days I have
no work, I hold her in my arms a bit to rest
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she got anything to amuse her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has a picture-book I got her last
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty, as soon as the
door closed behind Mrs. Scott, &ldquo;just think of
lying in bed since Christmas, and now it's the
first of May, with nothing but <i>one</i> picture-book!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Marty,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;there are
many people in the world who have very hard
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know them all, and I couldn't
help them all if I did; but I feel that I know
Jennie real well, and mayn't I give her some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of my books and playthings? a whole lot, so
that she wont be so lonesome when her mother's
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of going to see her soon,
and if you wish you may go too and carry her
a picture-book or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty in her usual wholesale way would have
carried half her possessions to Jennie, but Mrs.
Ashford prevailed upon her to limit her gift to
a small book and a few bright cards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would better see Jennie first,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She may not care for books and may be too
miserable to care much for playthings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It happened the day they fixed upon to go
Mrs. Ashford brought home from market a
small measure of strawberries, though they
were yet somewhat expensive. Marty, seeing
them on the lunch-table, nearly went wild over
them, being very fond of the fruit, but her
mother noticed that after she was served she
barely tasted them, and then sat with the spoon
in her hand gravely thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you like them after all, Marty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O mamma, they're perfectly delicious! I
was just thinking how good they would taste to
Jennie. Can't we take her some of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there are none to spare. You
know Katie must have some, and I want to save
a few for your papa.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I might take her mine,&rdquo; said Marty slowly.
&ldquo;I've only eaten one.&rdquo; But she looked at the
berries longingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be too much of a sacrifice, I
fear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;but I'll tell you what
we will do if you are willing. You set yours
aside for Jennie and I will give you half of
mine, and then we will all have some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty was afraid it would not be fair to have
her mother make a sacrifice also, but Mrs. Ashford
declared she should like it of all things, and
was very glad Marty had thought of taking some
berries to Jennie.</p>

<p>So the strawberries were put in a basket with
two glasses of jelly, some nice rusks that Katie
was famous for making, and a closely-covered
dish of chicken broth. Marty had her parcel
ready, and they set out on their expedition.</p>

<p>When they reached the house and knocked
at the door of the room Mrs. Scott had directed
them to, a weak but shrill voice cried out,
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They entered a neat but poorly furnished
room, of which the only occupant was a pale,
thin girl, lying in what appeared to be a very
uncomfortable position in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are Jennie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford,
with her pleasant smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; answered the girl, staring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Ashford. My little girl and I have
come to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennie probably had few visitors, and she
certainly did not know how to treat them. She
did not ask her present ones to be seated, and
merely continued to stare at them as well as she
could stare in the doubled-up way she was
lying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother is out to-day, is she?&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she's only gone for half a day.
She ought to be home now,&rdquo; and then the poor
child broke into a whining cry, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish she'd come and fix me, for I'm all
slid down, and give me some dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is very hard to be polite and pleasant when
you are faint, sick, and generally miserable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wont you let me fix you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ashford.
She put the basket on the table, and
taking off her gloves, approached the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Marty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as I raise Jennie,
you beat up the pillows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty beat them with a will, and the sick
girl was soon comfortably placed. She appeared
greatly relieved and sighed from satisfaction.
Mrs. Ashford, seeing a tin plate on the shelf,
covered it with one of the napkins from her
basket, and placing on it the small glass saucer
of strawberries and a rusk, gave it to Marty to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
carry to Jennie. The wan face of the invalid
flushed with pleasure when she saw the dainty
food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it's for you,&rdquo; replied Marty, settling
the plate on the bed.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Scott entered, almost breathless
from her hurried walk, having been detained,
and knowing Jennie would need her.
She was exceedingly grateful when she found
Mrs. Ashford and Marty ministering to her sick
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O mother!&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;The lady
lifted me up in bed; and see the strawberries!
Some are for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested her mother, but Jennie
persisted in forcing at least one upon her.
When Marty saw how the berries were enjoyed
she felt very well repaid for having been satisfied
with a smaller portion herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford inquired what had been done
for Jennie, and found she had had no doctor
since coming to the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no money to pay a doctor,&rdquo; said poor
Mrs. Scott, wiping her eyes, &ldquo;and I can't go to a
stranger and ask him to attend her for nothing.
I give her the medicine the doctor told me to get
when she was first hurt, but it don't seem to do
any good now.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford said she would speak to a doctor not
far from there, with whom she was well acquainted, and
she was sure he would be willing to come and see what
could be done for the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very hard that you have to be away from her so
much, when she is sick, and almost helpless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard, mem, but what can I do? I must work to pay
the rent and get us bread, and glad enough I am to have
the work. And she's not always so forlorn as you found
her, for mostly she can move herself. She's a bit weak to-day.
Then when I go for all day, I leave things handy on a
chair by the bed, and the people in the house are real kind,
coming in to see if she wants anything and to mend the
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime the children were not saying much, for
Jennie, besides being somewhat shy, appeared tired and
weak. She was greatly pleased with the book and cards,
holding them tenderly in her hands. Marty sat in silence a
while, and then asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a doll?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jennie. &ldquo;I never had one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never in your whole life!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty,
extremely astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jennie quietly. &ldquo;But wunst we lived next
door to a girl who had one, and sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
she let me hold it. It was the very beautifulest
kind of a doll, <i>I</i> think,&rdquo; she added with great
animation: &ldquo;had light curly hair and big blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty was so overcome that she could do
nothing but stand and gaze at the little girl who never
had a doll, and nothing more was said until her
mother was ready to go home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<h3>LAURA AMELIA.</h3>

<p>On their way home Mrs. Ashford stopped at Dr.
Fisher's, and finding him in his office, made
her plea, and readily obtained his promise to see
Jennie.</p>

<p>All the way Marty was unusually silent and
appeared to be thinking intently. When they
were nearly home she said impressively,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, do you know, Jennie never had a doll&mdash;never
in her whole life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am; and I've been thinking I'd
like to give her one of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you could part with any of
yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love them all dearly, but I think I <i>could</i> do
it to make Jennie happy. I know she'd like to
have a doll, and it would be a long time before I
could save money enough to buy her one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;I'm sure she
would be very happy with one of yours, but you
had better take time to think it over well, and
not do anything you would afterward regret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty thought it over until the next evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and then said she still wished to give Jennie the
doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;I am
willing you should do it. Which doll do you
think of giving her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura Amelia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she is your third largest and one of
your prettiest! Why do you choose her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Jennie would like a fair doll, and
she's the only fair one I have except the one
Grandma Brewster gave me, and I shouldn't
like to give that away.&rdquo; And then she repeated
what Jennie had said about the next-door girl's
doll.</p>

<p>So it was settled that Laura Amelia was to
leave home the next Saturday. Her clothes
were put in good order, and Mrs. Ashford made
her a travelling dress.</p>

<p>On Friday night when Marty, in her little
wrapper and worsted slippers, made her appearance
at the sitting-room door to say &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;
she had Laura Amelia clasped in her
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa! Miss Moppet,&rdquo; said her papa. &ldquo;Are
you off? What's the matter with that dolly?
Do you have to walk her to sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. She's very good, but she's going
to sleep with me, because it's the last night
she'll be here.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Marty tried to reply steadily, but her voice
trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said her papa sympathizingly. &ldquo;Where
is she going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to give her to Jennie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Ashford had heard all about
Jennie. He approved of her being helped, but
did not like to see Marty in distress, and he
noticed her eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shame for the child to give away
playthings she is fond of,&rdquo; he said to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't tell her to give it,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Ashford.
&ldquo;It was her own notion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Marty,&rdquo; said her father, putting his
hand in his pocket, &ldquo;you keep that doll yourself
and I'll give you some money to get Jennie
another one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, papa,&rdquo; said Marty earnestly.
&ldquo;Thank you ever so much, but I want to give
Jennie a doll all myself, and I've quite made up
my mind to give her this one. I thought it
over a whole day&mdash;didn't I, mamma? You
mustn't s'pose I don't <i>want</i> to give Laura
Amelia to Jennie, because I do, but you know
such things make one feel a little sad for a
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume they do,&rdquo; said Mr. Ashford,
smiling as he lifted both Marty and the doll
to his knee. &ldquo;How many dolls have you?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven, counting the two little china ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that's a pretty numerous family for one
small girl to care for. I guess you can spare
Lucy Aurelia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy Aurelia!&rdquo; Marty laughed heartily.
&ldquo;O papa, what is the reason you never can
remember my dolls' names?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how you can remember them
yourself.&rdquo; Then as he kissed her goodnight he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad my little girl is learning to be kind to
the poor and friendless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day there was some prospect that
Marty would not get to Jennie's after all, as Mrs.
Ashford could not very well go with her and would
not let her go alone. Marty was preparing to be
dreadfully disappointed, but her mother said, &ldquo;Wait
until after lunch and we will see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then there was a tap at the door, and a tall,
dark-eyed, smiling young lady entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here's Cousin Alice!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty, and
the warm welcome the visitor received from them all
showed what a favorite she was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've come to stay to lunch if you will have me,&rdquo;
she announced, throwing her wrap and gloves on the
couch. Marty immediately invited her to stay for
ever, and Freddie began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
building a wall with his blocks all around her
chair so that she could not possibly get away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford, after there had
been a good deal of talk and play, &ldquo;I am going
to ask you to do something for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be only too happy to do it, Cousin
Helen,&rdquo; said Miss Alice in her bright way.
&ldquo;You have only to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marty wants to do an errand down near the
old postoffice this afternoon. I don't like to
have her go into that part of the town by herself,
and I can't go with her. Would you be
willing to go with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; was the cordial reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that will be splendid,&rdquo; cried Marty.</p>

<p>Then both she and her mother proceeded to
tell their cousin all about Jennie, after which
Marty dressed the doll and packed its clothes in
a box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a good idea it is of Marty's to give
that doll and all its belongings to Jennie!&rdquo; said
Miss Alice. &ldquo;It will be such amusement and
occupation for her when she is alone so much.
It must be perfectly dreadful to lie there all day,
and day after day, with nothing to do and nothing
to interest her. I suppose she cannot read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very well, I fancy, for her mother said
they had moved about so much before she was
hurt that she had very little chance to go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
school. I suppose there is really not much of
anything she could do now, as she is so weak
and miserable, but it has just occurred to me
that if she gets stronger under Dr. Fisher's
treatment, you might help her to a light, pleasant
occupation which would enliven her dull
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? How? I'm sure I should be very glad
to do anything possible for the poor girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might teach her to crochet or knit.
You do such work to perfection and know so
much about it. I know you have plenty of odds
and ends of worsted and other materials, and I
can furnish you with a good deal more. If she
is able to learn, I think it would be a charming
work for her, and might be very useful in coming
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an excellent suggestion. I shall be
very glad to teach her, or at least try to teach
her, for I don't know how I should succeed in
the attempt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you would succeed beautifully, and it
need not take up much of your time, as Landis
Court is nearer you than it is to us, and you
could run over for a little while any time. But
you can see when you go whether it is worth
while to speak of the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be just lovely!&rdquo; was Marty's opinion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Marty,&rdquo; cautioned her mother, &ldquo;don't
you say anything about it to Jennie. Just let
Cousin Alice do it in her own nice way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks,&rdquo; said Cousin Alice with
her gay laugh. &ldquo;I'll be sure to do my prettiest
after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they made the visit, however, it was
found useless to mention crocheting or any
other subject to Jennie. Her attention was altogether
absorbed by the doll. Mrs. Scott happened
to be at home, and while she was bustling
around getting chairs for her visitors and
Marty was introducing her cousin, Jennie never
took her eyes from Laura Amelia. Presently
she said in a trembling voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I hold your doll a minute?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought her for you,&rdquo; said Marty, handing
the doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me to hold a minute?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; to keep. She's your dolly now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennie looked perfectly bewildered at first,
and then when she began to understand the
matter she clasped the doll in her arms and
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Marty was very much frightened. &ldquo;Oh!
don't let her cry,&rdquo; she said to Mrs. Scott. &ldquo;It
will make her sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, missy; she'll soon be all
right. Come now Jennie, don't cry. Sit up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and thank the little lady for the beautiful present.
But it's too much to give her. Who'd ha'
thought of you bringing such a handsome doll!
And just what she's always wanted but never
looked to having. I'm sure I don't know how
to thank you,&rdquo; and the poor woman threatened
to follow Jennie's example, and cry over their
good fortune.</p>

<p>Then Cousin Alice came to the rescue by
suggesting that Marty should tell Jennie the
doll's name and show her wardrobe. The little
girls were soon chattering over the contents of
the box, and Miss Alice learned from Mrs.
Scott that the doctor had been to see Jennie.
He said he saw no reason why with proper
treatment she should not become well again,
though it was likely she would always be somewhat
lame and perhaps never very strong. He
had sent her strengthening medicine and said
she must drink milk every day.</p>

<p>Then began better times for Jennie than she
had ever had in her life before. First, as she
would have said herself, there was the doll to
love and cherish, to dress and undress, to talk to
and to put to sleep. Then there were the books
and pictures, for between Marty and Edith, who
also came, her stock of them increased rapidly.
Then there was the decrease of pain and the
increase of strength, for what with the bathings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and rubbings that the doctor ordered, and the
nourishing food that Mrs. Ashford and Miss
Alice sent, she began to get greatly better.</p>

<p>When she arrived at the point of sitting
propped up in bed for several hours at a time,
Miss Alice spoke of the crocheting and found
her exceedingly willing to learn. She took it up
quite rapidly too, and very much enjoyed working
with the bright worsteds.</p>

<p>Miss Alice was greatly interested in her
pupil and sometimes made quite long visits,
teaching her or reading to her, and her visits
made the little invalid so happy that she got
better all the faster.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE GOOD SHEPHERD.</h3>

<p>Marty and Edith often accompanied Miss
Alice when she visited Jennie. Sometimes they
each took a doll to visit Laura Amelia, also carrying
some of their dishes and having a dolls'
tea-party. This always pleased Jennie very
much, though at first she scarcely knew how to
play in this quiet, lady-like fashion, as she had
only been accustomed to playing in the street
with rough children before she was hurt. Of
course she had had no chance at all to play during
the last year.</p>

<p>Sometimes the girls read little stories to her.
This she viewed as a surprising accomplishment,
as she could only spell her way along, not being
able to read well enough to enjoy it. So in one
way or another they entertained her, making her
forget her weakness.</p>

<p>Sometimes they talked about other things,
telling her of the mission-band, though, as it was
something so outside of her experience, she
could, with all their explanation, hardly form
any idea of it. She took more interest in descriptions
of the country, the green fields, shady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
woods, and pretty gardens. She was very fond
of flowers, and during the early summer her
friends kept the poor room quite bright with
them. An old lady living near Mrs. Ashford,
and having an unusually large yard for the city,
had a great many flowers, and hearing of Marty's
sick friend in Landis Court, told her whenever
she was going over there to come and get some
flowers for Jennie. This delighted both little
girls extremely.</p>

<p>One day when they were all with Jennie, she
picked up one of her cards that had on it a
picture of a shepherd leading his flock and carrying
a lamb in his arms. She wanted to know
what it meant, and what a shepherd was, and
what sheep were. After it had been explained,
she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Shepherd' makes me think of a hymn they
used to sing in the Sunday-school down in the
Harbor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever go to Sunday-school?&rdquo; asked
Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went a little while when we lived down in
the Harbor. My teacher had a lovely velvet
cloak trimmed with fur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't she tell you about the Good Shepherd?&rdquo;
Edith inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. She didn't seem to know about any
kind of shepherd. Leastways she never let on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that she did. But they used to sing beautiful
hymns, and one was about a shepherd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it 'Saviour, like a shepherd lead us'?&rdquo;
asked Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the very one!&rdquo; exclaimed Jennie
in delight. &ldquo;How did you know that was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it might be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to have us sing it now?&rdquo;
Miss Alice inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they sang it, Jennie joining in whenever
they came to the words, &ldquo;Blessed Jesus,&rdquo; which,
besides the first line, was all she knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is blessed Jesus a shepherd?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the Good Shepherd,&rdquo; replied Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's his sheep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All who believe on Him are his sheep, for
the Bible says, 'My sheep hear my voice, and I
know them, and they follow me.'&rdquo; </p>

<p>Miss Alice saw that Jennie did not altogether
understand Edith, so in a few simple words she
explained that Jesus, our Lord and Saviour,
speaks of himself as the Good Shepherd, and
calls us to follow him. Then taking up the
picture again she repeated what she had said
about shepherds and their flocks, and also went
over some of the hymn they had been singing,
until Jennie began to get into her little muddled
brain quite a clear idea of Jesus, our Shepherd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your Bible? I will show you the
chapter about the Good Shepherd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ha'n't got one. Mother has one, but I
guess it's locked up in that little black trunk.
It's a purple one with clasps that somebody
gave her long ago, and she always had to keep
it hid for fear papa'd sell it for whiskey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennie said all this very coolly, she was so
much accustomed to the kind of life in which
there was more whiskey than Bible; but Edith
and Marty looked much shocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Miss Alice, &ldquo;I will bring
my Bible the next time I come and read the
chapter to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a beautiful plan flashed into Marty's
head, and as Edith was included in it, she could
not resist reaching over and giving her arm a
tiny squeeze. Edith must have partly understood,
for she answered with a smile.</p>

<p>In the meantime Miss Alice was saying to
Jennie,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear the Psalm beginning,
'The Lord is my Shepherd'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't b'lieve I ever did,&rdquo; said Jennie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marty, can't you and Edith repeat it for
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty was not sure she remembered it all,
but Edith knew it, and the beautiful Psalm was
reverently recited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening as Mrs. Scott, wearied with the
labors of the day, was seated in one of the stiff,
hard chairs doing some mending by the uncertain
light of a smoky lamp, Jennie told her all
that had been said and done in the afternoon,
and then asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, can't you find that about the shepherd
in your purple Bible and read it over to
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll try, but I'm a poor reader, Jennie, and
anyways I don't know as I can find the place
you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She unlocked the trunk and bringing forth,
wrapped in soft paper, an old-fashioned, small-print
Bible that had once been handsome, but
was now sadly tarnished, she screwed up the
smoky lamp and began to turn the leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know where the place is, child. I'm
none so handy with books, and there's a great
many different chapters here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was about green pastures and quiet
waters. Miss Alice said a pasture is a field, and
it minded me of that grassy field where Tim
took me the summer before he died. You know
there was a pond in it, and we paddled along the
edge. It was the prettiest place I ever saw, and
on awful hot days I wish I was there again. I
think it must be just such a place the Bible
shepherd takes his folks to.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Scott turned the leaves back and forth,
anxious to please Jennie, but unable to find what
she wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I mind,&rdquo; exclaimed Jennie presently:
&ldquo;Miss Alice didn't call the green pasture piece
a chapter; she called it a Psalm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! now I'll find it,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;I
know about Psalms, for my good old grandfather
used to be always reading them, and I used to
think it was queer the way they was spelt&mdash;with
a 'p' at the beginning. I saw them over here
a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then after a little more searching she inquired,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this it? 'The Lord is my Shepherd: I
shall not want.'&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; Jennie exclaimed joyfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott, though with some difficulty, managed
to read it, while Jennie listened with closed
eyes and clasped hands, thinking of the delightful
places into which the Shepherd leads his
flock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're sweet verses,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scott, as
she closed the book, after laying a piece of yarn
in to mark the place, &ldquo;and it rests a body to read
them. I call to mind now that many's the time
I've heard my granddad read 'em. And I've
heard 'em in church, too, when I used to go.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you go to church sometimes
now, mother?&rdquo; Jennie asked. &ldquo;There's nobody
to rail at you for going. You might borrow Mrs.
O'Brien's bonnet after she's been to mass, and
go round to the church on the front street, where
we hear the singing from every Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott began to think she should like
to go. She cleaned off her old black alpaca
as well as possible, and the next Sunday, borrowing
her kindly Catholic neighbor's bonnet,
she went to church for the first time in many
years.</p>

<p>She came home delighted, and had much to
tell Jennie about the pleasant gentleman who
gave her a seat and invited her to come again,
about the good sermon that she could understand
every bit of, and the rousing hymns,
which indeed Jennie could hear with the window
open.</p>

<p>Not long after this, one of the ladies Mrs.
Scott worked for gave her a partly-worn sateen
dress and a black straw bonnet, so that she was
fitted out to go to church all summer; and go
she did with great enjoyment. It was a pleasure
to Jennie also, for with listening to the
singing as she lay in bed, and hearing about all
that was said and done from her mother, she
almost felt as though she had been at church
herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The purple Bible was not locked up any
more, but kept handy for Miss Alice to read,
and to mark passages for Mrs. Scott to read in
the evening, for Jennie liked to hear the same
things over and over.</p>

<p>The plan that popped into Marty's head that
day she told to Edith on the way home, after
they had left Cousin Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Edie!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;wouldn't it be nice to
give Jennie a Bible for her very own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean for you and me together to give
it?&rdquo; said Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You know my birthday comes in
August and yours in September, and we always
get some money&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;And we could each give half, and get Jennie
a Bible,&rdquo; broke in Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; or if we <i>couldn't</i> do it then, we might
have enough by Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it would be a <i>beautiful</i> Christmas gift!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do let us do it,&rdquo; said Marty, seizing
Edith and whirling her around and around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Edith, panting for breath.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;NOW DON'T FORGET!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>It was well on in June, and Mrs. Ashford
was very busy making preparations to go to the
country with the children.</p>

<p>Two successive summers they had spent at a
very pleasant mountain farmhouse, but the last
year they had gone to the seashore. This summer
Mrs. Ashford decided for the farmhouse
again, to Marty's great delight, for it was a perfect
paradise to her.</p>

<p>She herself had many preparations to make&mdash;deciding
which dolls to take and which to leave
at home, and getting them all ready for whatever
was to be their fate. It also took a good
deal of time to choose from her little library the
few books her mamma allowed her to take for
rainy days. It was a weighty matter, too, to
select a suitable present for Evaline, the little
girl at the farmhouse, as her father suggested
she should do, and gave her money to buy it.</p>

<p>Then Jennie was very much on her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will she do for soup and jelly and
things when we are away, mamma?&rdquo; she asked
anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall tell Katie to carry her something
now and then,&rdquo; Mrs. Ashford replied. &ldquo;Besides,
Cousin Alice will be in town until August, and
she will look out for Jennie. Then Mrs. Scott
told me the other day that she had got all her
back rent paid up now, and she expects to have
three days' work every week all summer; so they
will get on very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another day Marty came home from Jennie's
in distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the doctor says Jennie
may soon begin to sit up in an easy-chair; and
they haven't got any. Their two chairs are the
most <i>uneasy</i> things I ever saw in my life. Now,
how is she going to sit up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford laughed as she said, &ldquo;Well, I
was going to give you a surprise, but I may as
well tell you now that I have sent that old rocking-chair
that was up in the storeroom to be
mended, and am going to give it to Mrs. Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty was overjoyed to hear this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, oh! mamma, wont you give them the
small table that stands in the third-story hall?
You always say it is only in the way there, and it
would be so nice beside Jennie's bed to put her
things on, instead of a chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose they might as well have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the red cover that belongs to it, mamma?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O Marty, Marty!&rdquo; exclaimed her mother,
laughing. &ldquo;How many more things will you want for
Jennie? But the red cover may go too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These things were sent, together with some
of Marty's underclothing, a pair of half-worn
slippers, and a couple of Mrs. Ashford's cast-off
gingham dresses, to be made into wrappers for
Jennie. Edith and Cousin Alice also brought
some articles for Jennie's comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will need a footstool with that chair,&rdquo;
said Cousin Alice. &ldquo;I have an extra hassock in
my room; I'll bring that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Howell sent an old but soft and pretty
comfort to spread over the chair, and which
would also be handy for an additional covering
in case of a cold night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A curtain on the window would soften the
light on hot afternoons,&rdquo; Miss Alice thought.
So she made one of some white barred muslin
she had and put it up. She also thought that as
Jennie still had not much appetite, some prettier
dishes than those Mrs. Scott had&mdash;they
were very few, and very coarse and battered&mdash;might
make the food taste better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, when I am ill,&rdquo; she said to Mrs.
Ashford, &ldquo;the way my food is served makes a
great difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she brought a cheap but pretty plate, cup,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and saucer, with which Jennie was extremely
delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we all go away there wont be anybody
to take flowers to Jennie,&rdquo; said Edith,
&ldquo;and I'm afraid she'll miss them. She does
enjoy them so much. I've a great mind to buy
her a geranium. May I, mamma? They're
only ten cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you may. I think it would be
very nice for Jennie and her mother to have
something of the kind growing in their room,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Howell.</p>

<p>She went with Edith to the florist's, and after
helping her to select a scarlet geranium, she
bought a pot of mignonette and another of
sweet alyssum for Edith to give to Jennie.</p>

<p>Marty helped Edith to carry their plants to
their destination, and what rejoicing there was
over that window-garden!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's too much! too much!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Scott, wiping her eyes as she looked around the
now really comfortable room.</p>

<p>Then when Miss Alice came in, as she did
presently, with four bright-colored Japanese
fans which she proceeded to fasten on the bare
walls, that seemed to cap the climax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There never were kinder ladies&mdash;never!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Scott, while Jennie was too
much overcome to say anything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It wont be so hard for Jennie to be shut up
here, and she wont miss Marty and Edith so
much, if she has these little bits of bright things
to look at,&rdquo; said Miss Alice.</p>

<p>Marty took the greatest interest in helping
to arrange all these things for Jennie's comfort
and happiness, and in thinking, too, how much
pleasure they would bring into poor Mrs. Scott's
hard-working life. When she went home after
her final visit to Landis Court, she said with a sigh of
relief,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now they're fixed comfor'ble, and we can
go as soon as we like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time that she had been so engaged
with Jennie she had not neglected the mission
band, but attended the meetings regularly and
became more and more interested in what she
heard there.</p>

<p>She still pursued the plan of giving to missions
at least a tenth of all the money she got.
During the spring and early summer she had
had two or three &ldquo;windfalls&rdquo; &mdash;one or two small
presents of money, and once her father had
given her a quarter for hunting out from an
enormous pile certain numbers of a magazine he
wished to consult. Besides she had made a little
money solely for the missionary-box by hemming
dusters for her mother.</p>

<p>The meeting on the third Saturday in June<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
was very important, as it was the last regular
meeting that would be held until September, and
there were many arrangements to be made.</p>

<p>Most of the girls and Miss Walsh herself
expected to be away two months, but several
members were to be at home all summer and a
few were only going away for a short time.
Miss Walsh said she did not think it fair that
those remaining in town should be deprived of
their missionary meetings. It had therefore
been decided that the meetings should be continued,
though not just in the same way as during
the rest of the year. No business was to be
transacted and the girls were not to sew unless
they wished.</p>

<p>At this &ldquo;good-by&rdquo; meeting, as they called
it, Miss Walsh had a few words to say both to
the stay-at-homes and to those who were going
away. To the first she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear girls, we leave the band in your hands
knowing you will do all you can for its best interests.
Mrs. Cresswell has kindly invited you
to hold your meetings at her house. I have
appointed four of the older girls to lead these
meetings&mdash;Mary Cresswell and Hannah Morton
in July, Ella Thomas and Mamie Dascomb in
August. I have given each of these leaders
some missionary reading in case you run short,
but I dare say you will find plenty of things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
yourselves. I also intend to write you a little
letter for each meeting, and should be glad to
have any or all of you write to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the others she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now when you are away having a good
time, don't forget missions. Keep up your interest
and come home ready to work more earnestly
and faithfully than ever. There are
many ways of keeping the subject fresh in your
minds and of helping along with the work even
in vacation times. But you know this as well
as I do, and I should like the suggestions as to
how to do it to come from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a pause Edith said, &ldquo;We all know the
subjects for the next four meetings, and we
might study and read just as we should do at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a good suggestion,&rdquo; said Miss Walsh,
&ldquo;and one I hope you will all adopt; for if you
don't, I'm afraid the go-aways will be far behind
the stay-at-homes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might remember what we hear about
missions and tell it when we come back,&rdquo;
said one of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be very instructive and pleasant,&rdquo;
said their leader; &ldquo;and you may have
plenty of opportunity to hear, as in these days
very interesting missionary meetings are often
held at summer resorts. Besides you may meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
individuals who can give you much information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might do as you are going to do and
write letters to the band at home,&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the band at home would like that
very much, but you must remember that they
must be letters suited to a missionary meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might join with others in holding
meetings,&rdquo; suggested Rosa Stevenson. &ldquo;In the
cottage where I was last summer there were
four other girls and two boys who belonged to
mission-bands, and we had a meeting every
Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Miss Walsh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we meet any children who don't know
about missions, we might tell them about our
band and what we do,&rdquo; said Daisy Roberts
timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing, Daisy!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Walsh, patting the tiny girl on the shoulder.
&ldquo;And you think that might start them up to become
mission workers, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; replied Daisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Marty, after various other
suggestions had been made, and she wondered
that no one had thought of this, &ldquo;I think we all
should take our missionary boxes and banks and
barrels and jugs along with us, and put money
in regularly as we do at home.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is <i>very</i> important,&rdquo; said Miss Walsh,
&ldquo;because if we neglect to lay by our contributions
at the right time, trusting to make up the
amount when we return home, we may find ourselves
in a tight place and our treasury will
suffer. And now, dear missionary workers,
wherever you may be, at home or abroad, don't
forget to pray every day for the success of this
work. Remember what we are working for is
the advancement of the kingdom of our blessed
Lord and Saviour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then before the closing prayer they all stood up
and sang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The whole wide world for Jesus.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This meeting filled Marty with the greatest
enthusiasm and she felt as though she could do
anything for missions. <i>She</i> would not forget
the subject for a single day, she was sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Miss Agnes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I sha'n't forget
missions. I'll study the subjects every week
and learn lots of missionary verses. I'll save
all the money I can; and I'll tell <i>somebody</i>, if it's
only Evaline, all I know about missionary work.
I'll tell her the first thing when I get there.
To be sure she can't have a band all by herself,
but it may do good somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>OFF TO THE MOUNTAINS.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Here's your train!&rdquo; said Mr. Ashford, hurrying
into the waiting-room where he had left
his wife and children while he purchased their
tickets. &ldquo;I'll carry Freddie. Come, Marty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they were waiting their turn to pass
through the gate Marty and her mother were
jostled by the crowd against two small, ragged,
dirty boys, who had crept by the officers and
were looking through the railings at the arriving
and departing trains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of these folks are goin' to the country,
where 'ta'n't so hot and stuffy as 'tis here,&rdquo; said
the larger boy. &ldquo;Was you ever in the country, Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; replied the other, a thin, pale little
chap about seven, leaning wearily against an
iron post. &ldquo;Never seed no country, but I <i>wants</i>
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty and her mother, who heard what was
said and saw the wistful look on the small boy's
face, pressed each other's hands and exchanged
a sorrowful glance. Then they were obliged to
move on; but after going through the gate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Marty pulled her hand out of her mother's and,
running back, took a couple of cakes from a
paper bag she carried and passed them through
the fence to the boys. How their faces brightened
at this little act of kindness!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marty, Marty!&rdquo; called her father, who had
not seen what she did and was afraid she would
get lost in the crowd, &ldquo;where are you? Hurry
up, child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, when he had made them comfortable
in the car and was about bidding them good-by,
he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Marty, when you change cars stick
closely to your mother and don't be running
after strangers, as you did a moment ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, papa,&rdquo; Marty protested earnestly,
&ldquo;they weren't strangers; at least I know that
littlest boy with the awfully torn hat. He is
Jimmy&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I can't stop now to hear who he
is, but I didn't know he was an acquaintance of
yours. However, don't run after anybody, or
you will get lost some of these days. Good-by,
good-by. Be good children, both of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that boy, Marty?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Ashford presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's Jimmy Torrence, and he lives in Jennie's
house. Don't you remember I told you
that one day, when we were all in Mrs. Scott's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
room singing to Jennie, a little boy came and
leaned against the door-post and listened? Mrs.
Scott told him to come in and took him on her
lap. She gave him a cup of milk, and after he
went away she said he had been sick with a
fever and his folks were very poor. There's a
good many of them, and they live in the third-story
back-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember. So that is the boy.
Poor little fellow! He looks as if he needed
some country air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Doesn't</i> he!&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;O mamma,
don't you think that society Mrs. Watson belongs
to would send him to the country for a
week? That would be better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear they cannot, for Mrs. Watson told
me the other day that there are a great many
more children who ought to be sent than they
have money to pay for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>wish</i> he could go,&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>The boy's pale, wistful face haunted her for
a while, but in the excitement of the journey it
faded from her mind.</p>

<p>After the rush and roar of the train how perfectly
still it seemed in the green valley where
stood Trout Run Station! How peaceful the
mountains! how pure and sweet the air!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Marty almost in a whisper,
&ldquo;everything is exactly the same as ever.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mountains don't change much,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Ashford as she seated herself on one of
the trunks and took Freddie on her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I mean this funny little station and the
tiny river and the old red tannery over there,
and the quietness and everything! And oh,
there's Hiram! He looks just as he did summer
before last, and I believe he's got on the
very same straw hat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiram, Farmer Stokes' hired man, who had
come to meet the travellers, now appeared from
the rear of the station, where he had been
obliged to stay by his horses until the train had
vanished in the distance. His sunburnt face
wore a broad smile, and though he did not say
much, Mrs. Ashford and Marty knew that in his
slow, quiet way he was very glad to see them.
He seemed to be particularly struck by the fact
that the children had grown so much, and when
Freddie got off his mother's lap and ran across
the platform, Hiram gazed at him in admiration,
also seeming highly amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't believe this tall girl's Marty, and as
for the little boy&mdash;why, he was carried in arms
the last time <i>I</i> saw him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two years makes a great difference in children,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; Hiram assented. &ldquo;Well, I
reckon we'd better be moving.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How I dread the steep hills,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford
as they were being helped into the wagon after the
baggage had been stowed away. &ldquo;I do hope your
horses are safe, Hiram. Now, Marty, be sure to hold
on with both hands when we come to the worst
places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you be 'fraid, Mrs. Ashford; there isn't a
mite of danger,&rdquo; said Hiram, gathering up the reins.
&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; cried Freddie, who had watched the
process of getting started with the greatest interest,
and who was now holding a pair of imaginary reins
in one tiny fist and flourishing an imaginary whip with
the other.</p>

<p>Hiram laughed aloud. That Freddie could walk
was funny enough, but that he could talk and make
believe drive was too much for Hiram. It was some
time before he got over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How's Evaline?&rdquo; asked Marty. &ldquo;Why didn't
she come to meet us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's spry. She wanted to come along down,
but her ma was afraid 'twould crowd you.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption"> They approached an open, level place from which there

<p>After a drive of about three miles among the
mountains, the winding road gradually ascending,
with here and there a somewhat steep incline, they
approached an open, level place from which there
was a magnificent view of what Marty called the
&ldquo;real mountains.&rdquo; For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
these wooded or cultivated hills they were driving
among were only the beginnings of the
range. Here was a cluster of houses and a
white frame &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; with green blinds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They've been doing right smart of building
in Riseborough since you were up,&rdquo; said Hiram
to Mrs. Ashford. &ldquo;You see the hotel's done,
and Sims has built him a new store, and
Mrs. Clarkson's been building on to
her cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the hotel a success?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First-rate. Full all last summer, and Dutton
expects a lot of folks this season. A big
party came up t'other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had a chance to see the guests at the
hotel, ladies on the piazzas and children playing
in the green yard, while Hiram stopped to do
an errand at the store, which was also the postoffice.</p>

<p>Nearly another mile of up-hill brought them
to their destination&mdash;a brown farmhouse with
its red barns and granaries standing in
the midst of smiling fields and patches of cool, dark
woods, while in the distance rose grand, solemn
mountains.</p>

<p>There was Evaline, seated on the low gatepost,
and Mrs. Stokes and her grownup daughter,
Almira, in the doorway, all on the lookout
and ready to wave their handkerchiefs the
moment the wagon appeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It's more like going to see some cousins or
something than being summer-boarders, isn't it,
mamma?&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we all are, Mrs. Stokes!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Ashford from the wagon. &ldquo;Quite an addition
to your family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more the merrier! I'm right down
glad to see you,&rdquo; said good-natured Mrs. Stokes,
coming to lift the children down and kissing
them heartily.</p>

<p>The travellers were very tired after their
long day's journey. Mrs. Ashford and Marty
were ready to do justice to the good supper provided,
but Freddie was only able to keep his
eyes open long enough to eat a little bread and
milk. The next morning, however, he was as
bright as a button, and took to country life so
naturally that he was out in the yard feeding
the chickens before his mother knew what he
was about.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<h3>A PLAN AND A TALK.</h3>

<p>Marty so enjoyed being back at the farm,
and there was so much to see and to do, that for
four or five days she could think of nothing else.
She and Evaline raced all over the place, climbing
trees and fences, playing in the barn or
down in the wood, paddling in the little brook,
riding on the hay-wagon, and going with the
boy to bring home the cows.</p>

<p>In short, the delights of farm life for the
time being drove everything else out of Marty's
head, and it was not until Sunday morning that
she gave a thought to missions. Perhaps she
would not have remembered even then had not
her mother said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marty, here are your ten pennies. I forgot
to give them to you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; thought Marty. &ldquo;In spite of what
Miss Agnes said the very last thing, I've forgotten
all about missions. I've never told
Evaline a breath about them, and I haven't
prayed or done anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got out her box and put in it her tenth,
and four pennies for a thank-offering for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
happy time she had been having. She also got
the list of subjects Miss Walsh had furnished
her with, and some of her books; but there was
no time to read then, for her mother had said
she might go to church with Mr. and Mrs.
Stokes, and she must get ready. Evaline was
not at home, her uncle having called the previous
evening and taken her to spend a couple
of days at his house.</p>

<p>There was preaching that Sunday in the
schoolhouse at Black's Mills, a village between
four and five miles distant in the opposite direction
from Riseborough. It was quite a novelty
to Marty to go so far to church, but it was a
lovely drive and she enjoyed it extremely. It
certainly seemed strange to attend service in the
battered little frame schoolhouse, without any
organ or choir, and to eat crackers and cheese in
the wagon on the way home, as Mrs Stokes was
afraid she would be hungry before their unusually
late dinner. But Marty was so charmed
with country life and all belonging to it that she
considered the whole thing an improvement
upon city churchgoing.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she took her Bible and some
missionary leaflets, and going into a retired
place in the garden read and studied for more
than an hour. The missionary spirit within her
was fully awake that day. She longed to talk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
with Evaline and could hardly wait until it was
time for her to come home. But by Tuesday,
when she did come, Marty's head was full of
other matters, such as a discovery she had made
in the wood of a hollow in an old tree which
would be a lovely playhouse, and an expedition
to Sunset Hill that was being talked of. So in
one way or another nearly two weeks of vacation
had passed before this Missionary Twig,
who had been so ardent to begin with, had
redeemed her promise of trying to interest
somebody in the work.</p>

<p>But in the meantime she had thought of Jimmy
Torrence. The way he was brought to her
mind was this. She was with her mother on the
side porch, Monday morning, when Mrs. Stokes,
coming out of the kitchen with floury hands,
inquired,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ashford, did you see the little boy in
the carriage that just passed 'long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you just ought to have seen him when
they brought him up here three weeks ago&mdash;his
folks are boarding over at Capt. Smith's; such a
pale, peaked child <i>I</i> never saw! Had been
awful sick, they said, and now you see he looks
right down well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, he does,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford. &ldquo;I
should never imagine he had been ill very recently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
The country has certainly done him
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just it!&rdquo; said Mrs. Stokes. &ldquo;There's
nothing like taking children to the country a
spell after they've been sick. Makes 'em fat
and rosy in less than no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! mamma,&rdquo; exclaimed Marty. &ldquo;That
makes me think of poor little Jimmy. I wish
we could do something to get him sent to the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we could, but I don't see any way to
do it. I have given all I can afford this summer
to the different Fresh-Air Funds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't you think of anything, clothes or
such things, that you were going to get me, and
that I <i>could</i> do without, and send the money to
Mrs. Watson?&rdquo; pleaded Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't think of anything just this minute,&rdquo;
answered her mother with a gentle smile, &ldquo;but
if you will bring Freddie in out of the hot sun,
and get something to amuse him near here, I'll
try to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do, please. And mind, mamma, it
must be something for me to do without&mdash;not
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty ran down the yard to where Freddie,
with red face and without his hat, was
rushing up and down playing he was a &ldquo;little
engine.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Freddie,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;don't you want to
come and make mud pies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a favorite amusement of the small
boy, and instantly the little engine subsided into
a baker. Marty led him up near the porch,
where there was a nice bed of mould&mdash;&ldquo; clean
dirt,&rdquo; Mrs. Stokes called it&mdash;and they were soon
hard at work on the pies.</p>

<p>Marty enjoyed this play as much as Freddie,
and it was some time before she thought of asking,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, have you thought of anything
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Marty, bounding up
on the porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know whether you will like the plan
or not, but it is the only thing that occurs to me.
Your school coat will be too short for you next
winter, and I was going to get you a new one.
But the old one could be altered so that you
might wear it. I have some of the material, and
could piece the skirt and sleeves and trim it
with braid. As it always was a little too large
for you about the shoulders, it would fit next
winter well enough that way. Doing that would
save about five dollars as near as I can calculate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we should have five dollars for Jimmy?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would it be much trouble to you to alter
the coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be some trouble, but I am willing
to take that for my share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! then let's do it,&rdquo; cried Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;You must
think it over first. You know when you do
things in a hurry, sometimes you regret them
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I sha'n't regret this,&rdquo; Marty protested;
&ldquo;but I'll go and think a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went and sat down on her last batch of
pies, resting her head on her knees, with her
eyes shut. In a very short space of time she
was back at her mother's side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you have not thought long enough,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ashford. &ldquo;I meant for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's no use thinking any longer, for I
know I'll think just the same. I've thought all
about how the coat will look when it's pieced,
and how all the girls will know it's pieced, and
how I'd a great deal rather have one that isn't
pieced. Then I thought how pale and sick Jimmy
looks, and how much he wants to go to the
country, and how much good it would do him to
go, and how he has no nice times as I have,
and, I declare, I'd rather wear pieced coats all
the rest of my life than not have him go.&rdquo; She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
winked her eyes very hard to keep back the
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford, stroking the
little girl's flushed cheek, &ldquo;we will consider it
settled. I will write to Mrs. Watson this afternoon,
inclosing the money, and telling her about
Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By Saturday a reply came from Mrs. Watson
saying that arrangements had been made to
send Jimmy to a kind woman in the country,
who would take good care of him, and it was
probable the money Marty had sent would pay
his board there for nearly three weeks. She
also said that Jimmy had been very poorly
again. Dr. Fisher, finding him in Mrs. Scott's
room one day when he called, had seen how
miserable the boy was, and had given him medicine,
and had said, when he heard he was going
to be sent to the country, that it would be just
the thing, better than any amount of medicine.
The letter also stated that Mrs. Fisher had fitted
Jimmy out in some of her little boy's clothes.
So he would be very comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could anything be nicer!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty.
&ldquo;I'm so glad of it all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same mail that brought Mrs. Watson's
letter brought Marty's little missionary magazine,
which she always wanted to sit right down
and read.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said her mother, after they had got
through talking over the letter, &ldquo;I wish you
would mind Freddie while I write some letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty took her magazine into the back yard
where Freddie was playing with his wheelbarrow
under the lilac-bushes. She sat down by
the big pear-tree to read, though not forgetting
to keep an eye on her little brother's proceedings.
Missions seemed as interesting as ever as
she read. Presently she saw Evaline coming
out of the kitchen with a pail of water and brush
to scrub the back steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evaline,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;when you get through
your work come down here where I'm minding
Freddie, wont you? I want to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Evaline, &ldquo;I'll come pretty
soon. This is the last thing I've got to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She soon came and threw herself on the
grass beside Marty, who forthwith began showing
her the magazine and telling her in a rather
incoherent way about mission work in general
and their band in particular. She told how
many belonged to the band, what they did at
the meetings, how much money they had, and
what they were going to do with it; how this
band was only one of hundreds of bands that
were all connected with a big society; and how
the object of the whole thing was to teach the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
heathen in foreign lands about God and try to
make Christians of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must be the same thing that Ruth
Campbell was talking so much about a while
ago,&rdquo; said Evaline when Marty stopped, more to
take breath than because she had nothing further
to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who's Ruth Campbell? and what was she
saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the Campbells live in that house that
you can just see the top of from our barn.
Ruth's as old as our Almiry, but she knows a
heap more, for she went to school in Johnsburgh.
She taught our school last winter, and
is going to again next. She told us about something
they have in Johnsburgh, and it sounds
very much like yours, so it must be a mission-band.
She said she wished we could have one
here, but none of us paid much attention to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think you would like it ever so much,&rdquo;
said Marty; &ldquo;only maybe there wouldn't be
enough children round here to make a band,&rdquo;
she added doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many does it take?&rdquo; asked Evaline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bands are of different sizes. I s'pose
you <i>could</i> make one of four or five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a sight more children than that on
the mountain,&rdquo; said Evaline with some contempt.
&ldquo;But then some of 'em mightn't want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to send their money away to the heathen; and
anyhow, I don't know where they'd get any
money to send. Folks up here, 'specially children,
don't have much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought the country was just the
place to make money for missions,&rdquo; cried Marty.
&ldquo;There's 'first-fruits' and such things that are
a great deal easier got at in the country than in
town. And I have heard of children raising
missionary corn and potatoes, and having missionary
hens that laid the very best kind of eggs
regularly every day, that brought a high price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but who's going to buy the things up
here? Folks all have their own corn and potatoes
and hens. And how'd we children get a
few little things miles and miles to market?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty was rather taken aback by this view
of the subject. &ldquo;The children I read about got
<i>somebody</i> to buy their things,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She was rather discouraged because Evaline
was not more enthusiastic about missions, and
thought there was no use trying to further the
cause in this region; but fortunately she happened
to tell Almira what they had been talking
of, and she took up the subject as warmly as
Marty could wish, saying she thought it would
be very nice to have a missionary circle of some
sort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruth has talked to me about it,&rdquo; she said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
&ldquo;and I promised to help, but we can't seem to
get the children interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren't there <i>any</i> interested, not even
enough to begin with?&rdquo; inquired Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there are Ruth's two brothers and
sister, and I think Joe and Maria Pratt, who
live just beyond Campbell's, might be talked
into it. Then there's Eva, but she doesn't
seem to care much about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care a great deal more since I heard Marty
tell about her band,&rdquo; Evaline declared, &ldquo;and I
wouldn't mind belonging to something of the
kind, only I don't see where I'd get any money
to give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'd try to manage that,&rdquo; said Almira.</p>

<p>After that for a few days there was a good
deal of talk among them all on the subject, and
some reading aloud afternoons from Marty's
missionary books. Finally Mrs. Stokes said she
thought it would be a very good thing for the
young people in the neighborhood to have a
society, and proposed that Almira and the little
girls should go over and spend the next afternoon
with Ruth, when they could talk the matter
over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE MOUNTAIN MISSION-BAND.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad Marty came up here this
summer, for I do believe, with her to help us, we
shall get the mission-band started at last,&rdquo; said
pretty, blue-eyed Ruth Campbell, after they had
all been talking for an hour or so as hard as
their tongues could go.</p>

<p>When she had learned what her visitors'
errand was, she had called her sister and
brothers and had sent Hugh over for Maria and
Joe Pratt. Then they had quite a conference on
the shady porch, Ruth sewing busily all the
while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid I can't help much,&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you have helped and are helping ever
so much. You've got Evaline all worked up, and
Maria too, and by telling us what you do in your
band you have given us many hints for ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Ruth,&rdquo; said Evaline, &ldquo;let's begin the
band right away, so that we can have some
meetings while Marty's here. You must be
president, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evaline has it all settled,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing.
Then turning to Almira she asked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
&ldquo;Which do you think would be best&mdash;just
start a kind of temporary band and wait until
school opens to organize, or organize now, trusting
to persuade others to join?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be best to organize now.
It will be easier to get them to join a band
already started than it will be to get them
stirred up to begin,&rdquo; was Almira's opinion.</p>

<p>Then she wished to know what they would
do about her. She wanted to belong, but then
she was not a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know of any band, Marty, that has
both children and young ladies?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Marty. &ldquo;In our church the
young ladies have a band themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this isn't a church band; it's a neighborhood
band,&rdquo; Ruth interposed; &ldquo;and as we
haven't many folks up here, I think it will be
well not to divide our forces, but to include all
in one organization. Of course Almira must
belong. I think, though, before organizing we
had better see and invite some of the other
neighbors. Effie, couldn't you and Maria go
over to McKay's and see what they think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Effie, a gentle girl of thirteen, just as pretty
and blue-eyed as her sister, thought she could.</p>

<p>Joe Pratt said he knew a boy he thought
might come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the Smiths, Evaline? Do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
think any of them would be interested?&rdquo; Ruth
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophy might,&rdquo; Evaline replied rather doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see her, wont you? They are
not far from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was finally resolved that as everybody was
so busy through the week during this harvesting
season, a meeting should be held the next Sunday
afternoon. The place chosen was a grove
which was just half way between Mr. Stokes'
and Mr. Campbell's. If, however, the day was
not suitable for an out-door meeting, they were
to assemble in Mr. Stokes' barn, a fine, new
affair, much handsomer than his house, and
occupying a commanding situation from which
there was a beautiful view.</p>

<p>When everything was settled the children
ran off to play, and Almira helped Ruth and her
mother to get supper.</p>

<p>The next Sunday was a lovely day, not too
warm, and the meeting in the grove was a
decided success. Altogether there were fourteen
present, though two were visitors, Marty
and one of Capt. Smith's summer boarders, who
came with Sophy. Ruth had a nice little programme
made out, and after the exercises they
organized. Ruth was elected president, Almira,
for the present, secretary, and Hugh Campbell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
treasurer. They decided as long as the weather
remained pleasant to meet every Sunday afternoon.
In winter, of course, they could not get
together so frequently.</p>

<p>They had already had, and continued to have,
many discussions about ways of earning their
missionary money. One thing the boys thought
of was to gather berries and sell them to the
people in the valleys, mountain blackberries
being esteemed very delicious. There would be
plenty of work about that&mdash;first climbing the
heights and then carrying their burdens for
miles.</p>

<p>Ruth was so much taken with Marty's plan
of making tenths the basis of what she gave to
missions that she concluded to adopt the same
plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's easy enough for you,&rdquo; said Almira.
&ldquo;You have your salary and half the butter-money,
but I have no income. You know we
don't sell much butter. I'll have to think of
some other way to earn a little money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do hurry and think what we can do,
Almira,&rdquo; said Evaline fretfully. She depended
on her sister always to do the thinking. &ldquo;I'm
afraid we wont have anything to give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; said Almira.</p>

<p>The result was she asked her father if he
would let her and Evaline have a strip of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
field adjoining the garden next summer, where
they might raise vegetables. When he consented
she asked Mrs. Dutton at the hotel if she
would buy these vegetables. To this Mrs. Dutton,
who knew the good quality of everything
from the Stokes farm, and what a &ldquo;capable&rdquo;
girl Almira was, readily agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now, Eva,&rdquo; said Almira, &ldquo;by weeding
and gathering vegetables you can earn your
missionary money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Almira,&rdquo; said Marty, &ldquo;how will you
ever get the things down to the hotel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the evenings Hiram has to go to
Trout Run to meet the market train, he can
take my baskets for the next day along. Other
days, if I can't do any better, I can harness
Nelly and take them down in the morning
myself before she is needed in the fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd have to get up awfully early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Almira, laughing. &ldquo;I'll
have to get up about three o'clock, I suppose, to
have the things ready in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three o'clock!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty in dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's going to be plenty of hard work
about your missionary money, Almira,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm willing to do the work,&rdquo; replied
Almira. &ldquo;From all Ruth says, it is a cause
worth working for.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but all that wont be till next summer&mdash;a
year off,&rdquo; objected Evaline. &ldquo;How are
we going to get any money sooner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Almira had another plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, one evening, &ldquo;instead of
hiring an extra hand this fall to sort and barrel
apples, wont you let Evaline and me do it, and
pay us the wages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you could do as much work as
a man?&rdquo; inquired the farmer good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll back Almiry for fast and good work
against any man <i>I</i> ever saw,&rdquo; said Hiram emphatically.</p>

<p>Mr. Stokes laughed quietly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;'t will be hard work, with all else you have to
do, but I'm willing you should try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do it,&rdquo; Almira answered determinedly.</p>

<p>After another spell of thinking she said to
Evaline, &ldquo;We might raise some turkeys next
summer. They bring a good price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, turkeys are such a bother!&rdquo; cried Evaline.
&ldquo;They take so much running after&mdash;always
going where they might get hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had had some experience in minding
young turkeys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just think of the money we'd have,&rdquo;
Almira reminded her. &ldquo;And you know we'll
have to work for our missionary money somehow.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Evaline, who was not fond
of work. &ldquo;It might as well be turkeys as anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Marty one morning, &ldquo;Hiram
says he'd like to join the band. But a great big
man can't belong to a mission-band, can he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might be an honorary member,&rdquo; suggested
Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a member is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could attend the meetings, take part in
the exercises, and contribute money, but he
could not vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe Hiram would like to join that
way. S'pose we ask him;&rdquo; and off she and Evaline
flew in search of Hiram.</p>

<p>They found him up by the barn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Hiram!&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;I just now told
mamma about your wanting to join the mission-band,
and she says you might join as an <i>honorary</i>
member.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiram stuck his pitchfork in the ground,
rested his hands on the top of it, and his chin on
his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that kind of a member got to do?&rdquo;
he asked slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may give money, but you can't vote,&rdquo;
Marty instructed him.</p>

<p>Hiram thought over it a good while, and then
said very gravely, though his eyes twinkled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, I guess giving money's the main
thing after all, isn't it? I reckon I'll join if
you'll let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll be ever so glad to have you,&rdquo; said
Marty warmly. She felt as if it was partly her
band, and was interested in seeing it growing
and flourishing.</p>

<p>They were nearly back to the house when
Evaline suddenly stopped, exclaiming,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never told him he might come to the
meetings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither I did! How came I to forget that!
We must go right back and tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they reached the barn again, they saw
Hiram at the foot of the hill, just entering the
next field; but hearing the girls shouting, &ldquo;Hiram!
Hiram!&rdquo; and seeing them running to overtake
him, he strode back across the fence, and
seated himself on the top rail to wait for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot a most important thing,&rdquo; said
Marty, panting for breath. &ldquo;Mamma says honorary
members may attend the meetings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I hadn't better attend them,&rdquo; said
Hiram with a quizzical look. &ldquo;I might want to
vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you think you should?&rdquo; asked Marty
anxiously.</p>

<p>Hiram bit off a piece of straw and chewed it,
slowly moving his head from side to side, appearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
to meditate profoundly, while the little
girls waited in suspense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, after he had apparently
thought the matter over, &ldquo;I suppose I can hold
up from voting; and I reckon you can count on
me to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And come he did, the very next Sunday, appearing
to take great interest in the proceedings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<h3>A FLOWER SALE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, look! Look over there!&rdquo; exclaimed
Marty. &ldquo;What are those lovely white flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild clematis,&rdquo; replied Evaline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Hiram, wont you please stop and let us
get some?&rdquo; pleaded Marty. &ldquo;I'd like so much
to take some to mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiram was obliged to go to Black's Mills on
an errand that morning, and Marty and Evaline
had been allowed to go with him for the ride.
Returning he had driven around by another
road, as he said one of the horses had lost a
shoe, and this road, though longer, was less
stony, and therefore easier for the horse than
the other. Besides it would take them by
McKay's blacksmith-shop, where he could get
the horse shod.</p>

<p>It was when going through a valley, which
the country folks called &ldquo;the bottom,&rdquo; that they
saw the clematis. It was growing in the greatest
profusion in the meadows and the woods on
both sides of the road, rambling over bushes,
rocks, fences, everything, with its great starry
clusters of white blossoms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think you had better go after any,&rdquo;
said Hiram in reply to Marty's request. &ldquo;Them
low places are muddy after the rain yesterday,
and your ma might be angry if you was to go
home with your shoes all muddied. Besides,
there <i>may</i> be snakes under them bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snakes! Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Marty with a
shudder. &ldquo;But I should like some of those
flowers for mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hiram, reining in the horses, &ldquo;if
you promise to sit still in the wagon and not be
up to any of your tricks of climbing in and out,
I'll get you some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you ever so much! I'll sit as
still as a mouse. But then I shouldn't like the
snakes to bite you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon they wont bite me,&rdquo; said Hiram, as
he leaped over the fence, and taking out his
knife proceeded to cut great clusters of flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just see the loads he is getting!&rdquo; cried
Marty.</p>

<p>Then as Hiram returned with a huge armful
which he carefully laid in the back of the
wagon, she said, &ldquo;Thank you many times,
Hiram. You are very kind. How pleased
mamma will be! But half these are yours,
Evaline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this they had what was to Marty the
pleasure of fording a small stream, where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
horses were allowed to stop and drink. Presently
they had a distant view of a cascade, called
Buttermilk Falls. As the road did not approach
very near, only a glimpse could be caught of the
creamy foam; but Hiram said that some day, if
Mr. Stokes could spare him, he would drive
them all down to that point, and they could
walk from there to the falls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon Mrs. Ashford would like to see
'em,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed she would,&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>Altogether the drive was what Marty considered
&ldquo;just perfectly lovely.&rdquo; And she was
delighted also to be able to go home with such
quantities of pretty flowers. She was already
planning with Evaline what vases and pitchers
they should put them in. &ldquo;How surprised the
folks will be when they see us coming in with
our arms full!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>When they reached a little wood back of Mr.
Stokes' barn, Hiram stopped the horses, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I've got to go 'round to McKay's, and
may have to wait there a considerable spell, so
you'd better just hop out here and go home
through the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He helped them out, gave them the flowers,
and drove on. The girls sat down under a tree
and divided the spoils. Marty contrived to
make a basket of her broad-brimmed brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
straw hat, in which she carefully placed her
flowers. Evaline's basket was her gingham
apron held up by the corners.</p>

<p>When they came within sight of the grove
where their missionary meetings had been held,
Evaline whispered,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, Marty! there are some ladies sitting
on our log.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, there were three young ladies,
evidently resting after a mountain climb, for
their alpenstocks were lying beside them, and
one, a bright, black-eyed girl wearing a stylish
red jacket, was fanning herself with her broad
hat. As Marty and Evaline drew near this
young lady called out gaily,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, little flower girls, where did you come
from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've been to Black's Mills in the
wagon with Hiram, and when we were coming
through the bottom he got this clematis for us,&rdquo;
explained Marty, who always had to be spokesman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it is beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed the young
lady. &ldquo;What wouldn't I give for some like it!
Did Hiram leave any or did he gather all for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there's plenty left!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must have some,&rdquo; said the young
lady, jumping up. &ldquo;Come, girls, follow your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
leader to this bottom, wherever it is, and let us
gather clematis while we may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny, Fanny, you crazy thing! Sit down
and behave yourself,&rdquo; cried one of her friends,
laughing. &ldquo;You have no idea where the place
is, and we have been walking for three or four
hours already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can't go,&rdquo; said Marty earnestly to
Miss Fanny. &ldquo;It's miles and miles away;
down steep hills and across the ford. Besides,
Hiram says there may be snakes among the
bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny,
reseating herself on the log, while the others
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>Then Marty said with pretty hesitation,
&ldquo;Wont you have some of my flowers? I'd like
to give you some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of mine, too,&rdquo; said Evaline, her generosity
overcoming her shyness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed!&rdquo; protested Miss Fanny.
&ldquo;Thank you very much, but I would not for the
world deprive you of them. Very likely you
have got it all arranged exactly how you are
going to dispose of them at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they had, but neither of them was a bit
selfish. Marty had already placed her hat on
the end of the log and was busily engaged in
separating a large bunch of flowers from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
rest, and Evaline, approaching the young ladies,
held out her apronful towards them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested the tall, fair girl, whom
her companions called &ldquo;Dora,&rdquo; &ldquo;perhaps you
would be willing to play you are real flower girls
and would sell us some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Fanny, &ldquo;let us
make a play of it. Little girls, how much are
your flowers?&rdquo; and she drew forth a long blue
purse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'T would be mean to sell what didn't cost
us anything, and what we didn't have to move
a finger to get,&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;I'd a great deal
rather you would let me give you as many as
you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it would not be mean at all when you
are giving up what you have so much pleasure
in. It would only be fair to take something in
exchange,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny. &ldquo;Just think!&rdquo; she
added persuasively, &ldquo;isn't there something
you'd each like to have a quarter for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty still held out against taking money for
the flowers, but all at once Evaline exclaimed
brightly, &ldquo;Oh, the mission-band!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mission-band!&rdquo; cried Miss Fanny. &ldquo;Familiar
sound! Are you mission girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so are we all. We must shake hands
all around.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>They did so, laughing, and feeling like old
friends. Then in ten minutes' chatter the young
ladies told what cities they were from and what
bands they belonged to, found out about Marty's
home band, and the newly-formed mountain
band she took such an interest in, and which
Evaline persisted in saying Marty started.
They were particularly delighted in hearing
about this last; they thought it highly romantic
that the meetings were held in that lovely grove,
and were amused by the idea of meeting in the
barn in case of rain, and also of Hiram's consenting
to join as an honorary member.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny, &ldquo;you will agree to
sell some of your flowers, wont you? See how
nicely it all fits in&mdash;we want some flowers very
much, and you want some money for your mission
work. So it's a fair exchange. Girls,&rdquo; she
said, turning to her friends, &ldquo;you know this is
Mrs. Thurston's birthday. Wouldn't it be lovely
if we could have about half this clematis to
decorate her room with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty declared if she was going to give them
a quarter apiece, she must take all, or most of
the flowers, instead of half. After much talk
it was finally arranged that the little girls were
each to keep what Miss Fanny called &ldquo;a good
double-handful,&rdquo; and the rest was handed over to
the young ladies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my first missionary money,&rdquo; said
Evaline, caressing her bright silver quarter in
delight.</p>

<p>Marty, also, appeared very well pleased with
the unexpected increase to her store.</p>

<p>Before separating Miss Fanny proposed another
plan. She had already stated that she and
her friends were staying at the hotel in Riseborough,
and had caused Evaline to point out
where she lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Day after to-morrow,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny, &ldquo;a
party of five or six of us are going to take a
drive to see some falls, and coming back we pass
right by your house. We shall probably be
along towards the close of the afternoon. Now
couldn't you be on the lookout for us, and have
some more missionary clematis for sale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't grow very near here,&rdquo; said Evaline,
&ldquo;and I don't believe Hiram would have
time to take us to the bottom again after any.
He's busy harvesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I don't wish you to go to so much
trouble about it; but cannot you get us flowers
of some kind near here&mdash;in some of these
woods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evaline, who was anxious for more missionary
money, said she thought there were still
some cardinal flowers down in the glen, and
Miss Fanny said they would be the very thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And then it would be more like earning the
missionary money if we had to work ourselves to
get the flowers,&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been brought up in the orthodox
school, I see,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny, and all the young
ladies laughed.</p>

<p>After many last words and kindly adieus,
they parted, and the children ran home to relate
their adventures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<h3>WEEDING.</h3>

<p>When the plan for Thursday was announced,
both Mrs. Ashford and Mrs. Stokes objected to
the little girls going so far into the woods by
themselves; and nobody could go with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we'll have no flowers for the ladies,&rdquo;
sighed Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no more missionary money,&rdquo; added
Evaline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not give them flowers out of the garden?&rdquo;
said Mrs. Stokes. &ldquo;Sakes alive! there's
plenty there. And they're just the kind I've
seen city folks going crazy over. Some of the
hotel folks were up here last summer, and deary
me! but they did make a to-do over my larkspur,
sweet-william, china pinks, candytuft,
cockscomb, and such. You just give the ladies
some of 'em, and they'll be pleased enough; for
there's hardly any flowers in Riseborough&mdash;too
shady, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's all well enough for Evaline,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;but Marty has no right to sell
your flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has if I give 'em to her, hasn't she?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
I'm sure she's welcome to every bloom in the
garden to do what she pleases with. Not that I
want my flowers sold; I'd rather give 'em to
the ladies, but as long as it is for mission
work&mdash;&rdquo; and the good woman finished with a
little nod.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ashford still objected to Marty's
taking the flowers, and Evaline would not have
anything to do with the scheme unless Marty
could &ldquo;go halves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Stokes,&rdquo; said Marty, &ldquo;can't you
think of some way I could work for the flowers,
and then mamma wouldn't object to my taking
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll tell you. The gravel walk 'round
the centre bed is pretty tolerable weedy, and if
you and Evaline'll weed it out nice and clean,
you may have all the flowers you want all summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That satisfied all parties, and the weeding
began that afternoon. When Marty was going
to do anything she always wanted to get at it
right away. Besides Almira advised them to do
some that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then maybe you can finish it up to-morrow
morning before the sun gets 'round there,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;This is a very good time to do it too&mdash;just
after the rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were armed with old knives&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
very sharp ones&mdash;to dig out the weeds with, if
they would not come with pulling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be sure to get them up by the
roots,&rdquo; said Almira, &ldquo;or they'll grow again before
you know where you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are going to do it <i>good</i>,&rdquo; Marty declared.</p>

<p>They divided the walk into sections, and set
to work vigorously. In a few moments Marty
remarked complacently,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bottom of my basket is quite covered
with weeds. But then,&rdquo; she added in a different
tone, &ldquo;I don't see where they came from. I
hardly miss them out of the walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few moments more of quiet work, and she
called out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evaline, are many of your weeds in <i>tight</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awful tight,&rdquo; answered Evaline disconsolately.
&ldquo;They've got the longest roots of any
weeds <i>I</i> ever saw. 'T would take a week of rain
to make this walk fit to weed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marty, &ldquo;of course it isn't just
as easy as taking a quarter for some clematis
that was given to us in the first place, but as it is
for missions I think we ought to be willing to do
it, even if it is a little hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; Evaline replied, brightening up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I'm very glad your mother thought of
this,&rdquo; Marty went on, &ldquo;for it would be dreadful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
disappointing not to have any flowers for the
ladies when they come, and not to get any more
missionary money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Evaline agreed with her, and the work
went on.</p>

<p>In about half an hour there was quite a large
clean patch, and much encouraged by seeing the
progress they were making, they worked more
diligently than ever. Then Marty had a sentimental
idea that it might help them along to
sing a missionary hymn, but found upon trial
that it was more of a hindrance than a help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't sing when I'm all doubled up this
way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and anyway when I find a very
tough weed I have to stop singing and pull.
Then I forget what comes next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it's better to work while you work
and sing afterward,&rdquo; was Evaline's opinion.</p>

<p>Here they heard somebody laughing, and
looking up saw Mrs. Ashford, who had come out
to see how they were getting on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Evaline is about right,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;singing and weeding don't go together very
well. But how nicely you have been doing!
Why, you are nearly half through!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; said Evaline, &ldquo;and the other
side of the circle a'n't half so bad as this was.
We'll easy get it done to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and, mamma,&rdquo; cried Marty, &ldquo;we've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
got them out good. I don't believe there'll
ever be another weed here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They'll be as bad as ever after a while,&rdquo;
said Evaline, who knew them of old.</p>

<p>Marty was pretty tired that evening and did
not feel like running about as much as usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Stokes, looking
at Marty as she sat on the porch steps after supper
leaning back against her mother, &ldquo;there
now! you're all beat out. 'T was too hard work
for you. I oughtn't to have let you do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! indeed, Mrs. Stokes, I'm not so very
tired,&rdquo; cried Marty, &ldquo;and I was glad to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another hour's work the next morning finished
the weeding, and the girls reflected with
satisfaction that they had earned their flowers.
Mrs. Stokes said the work was done &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo;
and Hiram, who was brought to inspect it, said
they had done so well that he had a great mind
to have them come down to the field and hoe
corn.</p>

<p>Thursday morning early they gathered and
put in water enough flowers for seven fair-sized
bouquets, thinking they had better have one
more than Miss Fanny mentioned in case an
extra lady came. By four o'clock these flowers&mdash;and
how lovely and fragrant they were!&mdash;with
Mrs. Ashford's valuable assistance were
made into tasteful bouquets, placed on an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
tray with their stems lightly covered with wet
moss, and set in the coolest corner of the porch.
The children, including Freddie, all nicely
dressed, took up position on the steps, partly to
keep guard over the flowers and prevent Ponto
from lying down on them, and partly to watch
for their callers.</p>

<p>Marty's bright eyes were the first to see the
carriages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they come around the bend!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, and shortly a carryall driven by Jim
Dutton, and containing three ladies and two
children, followed by a buck-board wherein
sat Miss Fanny and Miss Dora, drew up at the
gate.</p>

<p>Evaline's shyness came on in full force and
she hung back, but Marty, with Freddie holding
her hand, proceeded down the walk. They were
met by Miss Fanny, who had thrown the reins to
her friend and jumped out the moment the
horse stopped. She kissed Marty, snatched up
Freddie, exclaiming, &ldquo;What a darling little
boy!&rdquo; and called out, &ldquo;Come down here, Evaline!
I want to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Stokes, who was too hospitable to see
people so near her house without inviting them
in, now came forward to give the invitation, and
as they were obliged to decline on the score of
lateness, she called Almira to bring some cool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
spring water for them. Seeing Freddie approaching
dangerously near one of the horses,
Marty cried, &ldquo;Freddie, Freddie, come away from
the horse!&rdquo; and he gravely inquired, &ldquo;What's
the matter with the poor old horse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This made every one laugh and brought Mrs.
Ashford from the porch to take his hand and
keep him out of danger. So they were all
assembled at the roadside, and quite a pleasant,
lively time they had.</p>

<p>The flowers were asked for and Evaline
brought them, while Marty explained why they
were garden instead of wild flowers, and Mrs.
Stokes told how the girls earned them. The
bouquets were extremely admired. When proposing
the plan in the woods, Miss Fanny had
suggested &ldquo;ten-cent&rdquo; bouquets, but everybody
said ten cents was entirely too cheap for such
large, beautifully arranged ones, that fifteen
cents was little enough. There was one composed
entirely of sweet peas, as Mrs. Ashford
said those delicate flowers looked prettier by
themselves. This Miss Fanny seized upon,
insisted on paying twenty cents for, and presented
to a pale, sweet-faced lady in mourning.</p>

<p>She drew Marty to the side of the carriage
where this lady was, and said in a low voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thurston, this is the little girl I told
you of&mdash;the Missionary Twig who doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
leave her missionary zeal at home when she
goes away in vacation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady smiled affectionately as she pressed
Marty's hand, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to meet such an earnest little
comrade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! but you don't know,&rdquo; protested Marty.
&ldquo;I came very near forgetting the whole thing.
Indeed, it went out of my head altogether from
Tuesday till Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies laughed, and Miss Fanny said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thurston was a missionary in India
for many years, Marty, and would be there yet
if she was able.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;India!&rdquo; exclaimed Marty, with wide-open
eyes. &ldquo;In Lahore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had heard more about Lahore than any
other place, and to her it seemed like the principal
city in India.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Thurston. &ldquo;Far
from there, hundreds of miles. Lahore, you
know, is in Northern India, in the part known
as the Punjab, while my home was in the extreme
south near a city called Madura. Are you
especially interested in Lahore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am. It's where our band sends its
money. We have a school there. That is, we
pay the teacher. It is one of those little schools
in a room rented from a poor woman, who does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
her work in one corner while the school is going
on, and the teacher is a native.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; is the missionary who superintends
it, along with a lot of other schools. Do
you know her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I have seen her name in the missionary
papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have some of those little schools
when you were a missionary, Mrs. Thurston?&rdquo;
Marty inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did some school work, but more zenana
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is zenana work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Thurston noticed that preparations
were being made to drive on, so she merely
replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come down to the village and see me, and
we will have a good missionary talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you ever so much,&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;I
do hope mamma will let me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evaline was quite overcome when she learned
that Mrs. Thurston was a &ldquo;real live missionary,&rdquo;
and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's the first one I ever saw. I wonder if
they're all as nice as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After consultation with her mother, Marty
decided to give half her &ldquo;flower money&rdquo; &mdash;which
altogether amounted to eighty cents&mdash;to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
mountain band, and keep the other half for the
home band. &ldquo;Because, you see, this is all out-and-out
missionary money; there's no tithing to
be done,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Evaline never felt so large in her life as she
did when going to the band meeting the next
Sunday, with her eighty cents ready to hand to
Hugh Campbell.</p>

<p>The Saturday following that memorable
Thursday, Miss Fanny and Miss Mary again
presented themselves at the farmhouse, where
they were welcomed like old friends. After
some pleasant chat, and a lunch of gingerbread
and fresh buttermilk, Miss Fanny said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came this morning chiefly to bring you
an invitation from Mrs. Thurston. She wants
you all, or as many as possible, to come to an all-day
missionary meeting at the hotel next Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All day!&rdquo; exclaimed Almira.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. That sounds formidable, doesn't it?&rdquo;
laughed Miss Fanny. &ldquo;But I'll tell you about
it. We are going to sew for a home missionary
family. You must know that Mrs. Thurston,
after spending the best part of her life and the
greater part of her strength in the foreign field,
still does all, in fact, more than her poor health
will allow her to do for missions both at home
and abroad. She heard the other day that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
missionary family, acquaintances of hers, in Nebraska,
had been burnt out, and lost everything
but the clothes they had on. She told us about
them with tears in her eyes, and some of us discovered
she was laying aside some of her own
clothes for the missionary's wife and planning
how she could squeeze out a little money&mdash;for
she is not rich by any means&mdash;to buy some
clothes for the children. Well, the result was
we took up a collection of clothes and money at
the hotel, and Mrs. Thurston got Mr. Dutton to
go to Trout Run and telegraph to the Mission
Board that this missionary is connected with
that we would send a box of things in a few days
that will keep the family going until some
church can send them a good large box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how will you know what kind of garments
to send?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ashford. &ldquo;I mean,
what sizes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thurston knows all about how many
children there are, and their ages, so we can
guess at their sizes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford, discovering there was a little
girl near Freddie's age, and as he was, of course,
yet in &ldquo;girl's clothes,&rdquo; said she could spare a
couple of his suits, having brought an ample
supply. Some of Marty's clothes also were
found available.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had some things given us for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
lady,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny, &ldquo;a wrapper, a jersey, a
cashmere skirt, a shawl; also two or three children's
dresses. We have bought nearly all the
muslin in Mr. Sims' store, with some flannel and
calico. He is going to Johnsburgh Monday, and
will get us shirts for the missionary, stockings,
and such things. Monday is to be a grand cutting-out
day. Tuesday we are to have three
sewing-machines. Several of the village ladies
are coming to help, and we shall be very glad if
some of you will come. Mrs. Thurston particularly
desires that the little girls shall come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let us go,&rdquo; Marty said, while Evaline
looked it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford could not leave Freddie, and it
was not possible for both Mrs. Stokes and Almira
to go, so it was settled that the latter, the little
girls, and Ruth Campbell, whom Miss Fanny
wished Almira to invite, should walk down pretty
early in the morning, and Hiram should bring
the light wagon for them in the evening.</p>

<h3>THE HOTEL MISSIONARY MEETING.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;It was an elegant sewing-meeting,&rdquo; Marty
confided to her mother when she got home
Tuesday evening, &ldquo;and it wasn't a bit like that
one Aunt Henrietta had the last time we were in
Rochester. I liked this one best. There, you
know, the ladies came all dressed up, carrying
little velvet or satin work-bags, and we just had
thin bread and butter and such things for tea&mdash;nothing
very good. Here some of the ladies&mdash;of
course I mean the ones from the village&mdash;came
in calico dresses and sun-bonnets. And
they were so free and easy&mdash;sewed fast and
talked fast while they were there; and then if
they had to go home a little bit, they'd just pop
on their bonnets and off they'd go. Mrs. Clarkson
thought it was going to rain, and she ran
home to take in her wash, and another lady went
home two or three times to see how her dinner
was getting on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them stayed at the hotel to dinner,
and all that did stay brought something with
them, pies mostly, though some brought pickles,
preserves, and frosted cake. And every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
time Mrs. Dutton saw something being smuggled
through the hall she'd call out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Now I told you not to bring anything. The
dinner is <i>my</i> part of this missionary meeting.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they'd all laugh. They were all real
kind and pleasant. And such a dinner! I do
believe we had some of <i>everything</i>. And supper
was just the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hotel, though the boast of the surrounding
country, was a very plain establishment,
being nothing more than a tolerably large, simply
furnished frame house accommodating about
forty persons. But it was bright and home-like
and beautifully situated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thurston's meeting,&rdquo; as they called it,
was held in the large, uncarpeted dining-room,
and the dinner tables were set in the shady back
yard.</p>

<p>The sewing-room was a busy scene, with
Miss Dora and two other ladies making the
machines whir and groups of workers getting
material ready for the machines or &ldquo;finishing
off.&rdquo; Mrs. Thurston, appealed to from all sides,
quietly directed the work,&mdash;while Miss Fanny was
here, there, and everywhere, helping everybody.
Almira heard, in the course of the day, that Miss
Fanny was quite wealthy, that she had contributed
a great deal towards getting up the box,
and was going to pay the freight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>There were several children besides Marty
and Evaline. They were employed to run
errands, pass articles from one person to
another, and fold the smaller pieces of clothing
as they were completed. As the day wore on
and the novelty of the thing wore off, most of
the children got tired and went out to play; but
Marty, though she ran out a few minutes occasionally,
spent most of the time in the work-room,
keeping as close as possible to Mrs.
Thurston, to whom she had taken a great fancy.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner Miss Fanny came to Mrs.
Thurston and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mrs. Thurston, if you don't get out of
this commotion a while you will have one of
your bad headaches. Do go out in the air. We
can get on without you for an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Mrs. Thurston took Marty and went into
the grove back of the house, and it was while
sitting there on a rustic seat, with the magnificent
view spread out before them, that they had
their missionary talk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/ill158-clr.jpg" width="312" height="500" alt="" title="Page 158" />
<span class="caption">While sitting there on a rustic seat ... they had their
missionary talk. Page 158.</span></div>

<p>Mrs. Thurston described her home in Southern
India, and spoke of the kind of work she
and her husband did there&mdash;how he preached
and taught in the city and surrounding villages;
how she instructed children in the schools, and
visited the ignorant women, both rich and poor,
in their homes. Often, when not able to leave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>home on account of her children, she had classes
of poor women in her <i>compound</i>, as the yards
around the houses in India are called. She also
spent a good deal of time giving her servants
religious instruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is very, very hot
there, and we Americans can only endure the
heat by being very careful. At best we sometimes
get sick, and we must do all we can to
save ourselves up to teach and preach. That's
what we go there for. If we should cook or do
any work of that kind, we should die; so we
employ the natives, who are accustomed to the
heat, to do these things for us. Then, these servants
will each do only one kind of work. That
is, the sweeper wont do any cooking or washing;
the man who buys the food and waits on the
table wont do anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's very queer,&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it is their way. So we are obliged
to have several servants. But then the wages
are very low. Altogether it does not cost any
more, perhaps not as much, as one good girl
would in this country. They are a great deal of
trouble, too. They are not, as a rule, very honest
or faithful, and they have, of course, all the
heathen vices, and sometimes we have much
worry with them. But what I was going to say
is, that we do our best to teach these servants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
about God. We used to have them come in to
prayers every day, and on Sunday I would collect
them on the veranda and try to teach them
verses of Scripture, which I would explain over
and over again. On these occasions a good
many poor, lame, blind people from the neighborhood
would also come. These people were
so densely ignorant that it was hard to make
them understand anything, but in some cases I
think the light did get into their minds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Thurston told of the death of her
three dear little children, and Marty felt very,
very sorry for her when she spoke of the three
little graves in that distant land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven't you any living children?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, two. One of my sons is a missionary
in Ceylon, and the other, with whom I live, is a
minister in New York State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, it appeared, after many years of labor
in that hot climate, the health of both Mr. and
Mrs. Thurston broke down, and they were
obliged to leave the work they loved and come
back to America. In a short time Mr. Thurston
died.</p>

<p>Marty found out, somewhat to her surprise,
that the &ldquo;big society&rdquo; her band was connected
with was not the only one. Mrs. Thurston
belonged to an entirely different one, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
young ladies, Fanny, Dora, and Mary, to still
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see we belong to different religious
denominations,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thurston, &ldquo;and each
denomination has its own Society or Board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Nebraska missionary, now,&rdquo; suggested
Marty, &ldquo;I suppose he belongs to your de&mdash;whatever
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Denomination,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thurston, smiling.
&ldquo;No, he belongs to yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you are all working for him!&rdquo; exclaimed
Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. It would not do for these different
families of Christians to keep in their own
little pens all the time and never help each
other. But as yet it has been found best for
each denomination to have its own missionary
society, though there are some Union Societies,
and perhaps in coming years it may be all
union.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there's this mountain band,&rdquo; said
Marty reflectively. &ldquo;The people in it are not all
the same kind. I mean some are Methodists,
and some are Presbyterians, and the Smiths are
Baptists. I heard Ruth say she didn't know
what would be best to do with their money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She afterwards heard Ruth consulting Mrs.
Thurston about the matter, and the latter spoke
of one of these union societies. Ruth said she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
would speak to the others and see if they would
wish to send their funds there.</p>

<p>By half-past four a great deal of work had
been done, and the new garments were piled up
on a table in the corner of the room. Though
needles were still flying, taking last stitches, the
hard-driven machines were silent, having run
out of work, as Miss Fanny said. In the comparative
quiet Ruth was heard singing softly
over her work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sing louder, Ruth,&rdquo; said Almira, and Ruth
more audibly, but still softly, sang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;From Greenland's icy mountains.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One voice after another took up the refrain,
and by the time the second line was reached the
old hymn was sent forth on the air as a grand
chorus. The children came up on the porch, the
girls came out of the kitchen to listen. The
customers in Sims' store and the loungers around
the blacksmith's shop stopped talking as the
sound reached them.</p>

<p>When the last strains died away, and before
talking could be resumed, Ruth said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marty, wont you say those verses you said
at our last band meeting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll say them if the ladies would like to
hear them,&rdquo; said Marty, who was not at all
timid, and knew the verses very thoroughly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
having recited them at the anniversary of her
own band.</p>

<p>The ladies desired very much to hear them,
and, taking her stand at one end of the room, she
repeated very nicely those well-known lines beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;An aged woman, poor and weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heard the mission teacher speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slowly-rolling tears came down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her withered features brown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What blessed news from yon far shore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I had heard it long before!'&rdquo; <br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;How touching that is!&rdquo; said one of the hotel
ladies, and Mrs. Sims was seen to wipe her eyes
with the pillow-slip she was seaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thurston,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny, who saw
that a good start on a foreign missionary meeting
had been made, and was not willing to let the
opportunity be lost, &ldquo;when you were in India
did you meet many persons who were anxious to
hear the gospel, or were they mainly indifferent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In replying to this question Mrs. Thurston
told many interesting things that had come
under her observation, and this led to further
questions from others, so they had quite a long
talk on missionary work both in India and other
countries. Finally one of the boarders asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do you think the world ever will be
converted to Christianity?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it will,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Thurston; and
she quoted, &ldquo;All the ends of the world shall remember
and turn unto the Lord; and all kindreds
of the nations shall worship before thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> &ldquo;For it is written, As I live, saith the
Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every
tongue shall confess to God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora.</span> &ldquo;The earth shall be full of the knowledge
of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> &ldquo;He shall have dominion also from
sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of
the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dora, Dora,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny, with an imperative
little gesture, &ldquo;'Jesus shall reign'&rdquo; &mdash;</p>

<p>Miss Dora obediently began to sing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Jesus shall reign where'er the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does his successive journeys run,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and was at once joined by the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, dear friends,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thurston,
when the hymn was finished, &ldquo;upon this, the
only occasion we are all likely to be together,
shall we not unite in asking God to hasten the
coming of this glorious time, and ask for his
blessing on our humble attempts to work in this
cause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Work was dropped and every head bowed, as
Mrs. Thurston uttered fervent words of prayer
that the Lord would fill all their hearts with love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
for missions, and that he would permit them to
do something towards helping in the work. She
prayed especially for the children who were
engaged in missionary work, and asked that
they might have grace given them to devote
their whole lives to the service of God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clarkson, as she was leaving,
&ldquo;this has been a right down pleasant meeting,
and I think the last part was just about the
best.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE GARDEN MISSIONARY MEETING.</h3>

<p>Two or three days afterwards Miss Fanny,
with one of her young friends, came up to tell
the farmhouse people that the box had gone.
She said that Mr. Sims had given them a box,
and had also kindly attended to sending it off.</p>

<p>The day after the meeting, when Hiram
went down to the postoffice, Marty and Evaline
had each sent by him a book for the missionary
children, and Miss Fanny said that this prompted
some of the children at the hotel to send books.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the summer there
was frequent intercourse between the hotel and
the farmhouse, and the &ldquo;mission workers,&rdquo; particularly,
learned to love each other very much.
Marty felt very proud to be numbered among
these workers, though she was only a &ldquo;twig.&rdquo;
She said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have a great deal to tell Miss Agnes
and the girls when I go home&mdash;sha'n't I, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some new members joined the mountain
band, and by the last of August it numbered
twenty-one. Ruth said she wished very much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
that before Mrs. Thurston left they might have
her meet with the band. She thought they would
all take greater interest in mission work if they
could hear something of it from one who had
spent so many years in the midst of it. Mrs.
Thurston said she would be very happy to attend
a meeting and talk with the members. So arrangements
were made to have her do so.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for her to reach the
grove, as she could not walk so far, and the drive
from the hotel to Mr. Campbell's was very rough
and quite long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Almira, when they were trying
to settle the matter, &ldquo;couldn't we have a
meeting here? It would be easier for Mrs.
Thurston to get here, and convenient enough
for everybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course they may meet here,&rdquo; her
mother replied. &ldquo;Our parlor's a plenty big
enough to hold 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear Mrs. Stokes,&rdquo; protested Marty,
&ldquo;don't let us meet in the house when there's
so much lovely out-of-doors. That grassy place
in the garden near the currant-bushes would be
just an elegant place for a meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vote with Marty for out-of-doors,&rdquo; said
Ruth. &ldquo;We'll have enough times for in-door
meetings after a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suit yourselves,&rdquo; said kind Mrs. Stokes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
&ldquo;You're welcome to any place I've anything to
do with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may some of the rest of us from the
hotel come?&rdquo; asked Miss Fanny, who happened
to be present when this talk was going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. The more the&mdash;.&rdquo; Mrs. Stokes
was just going to say, as she so often did, &ldquo;the
more the merrier,&rdquo; when she recollected that it
would be Sunday and the meeting a religious
one. But she let them all know she would like
them to come. Mrs. Ashford and Ruth had
great difficulty in persuading her not to bake a
quantity of cake on Saturday and serve refreshments
to the band.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must remember, dear Mrs. Stokes,&rdquo; said
Ruth, &ldquo;it isn't a party, and nobody will expect
anything to eat. Now you must not think of
going to any trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idee of having a lot of people come to
your house and not give 'em a bite of anything!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Stokes.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon chairs were carried out to
the grassy spot Marty had selected, among
them a comfortable arm-chair for Mrs. Thurston.
Marty insisted on farmer Stokes' special
arm-chair being carried out for him, and with
the help of Wattie Campbell contrived to get it
there. Hiram, before he drove down to the
hotel for the ladies, made a couple of benches of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
boards placed on kegs. These were for the
girls. The boys, he said, could sit on the
ground, and that is where he sat himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurston brought with her a cloth map
of India which the young ladies fastened to two
trees. She also had some photographs of people
and places in India which were passed around
among the company. Mr. Stokes was particularly
struck with the beautiful scenery these
pictures showed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never knew much about
India, but I had no idea it was such a handsome
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thurston, &ldquo;the scenery
in some parts of these tropical countries is very
fine, the foliage is so luxuriant, the flowers so
gorgeous, the skies so brilliant. Indeed, a photograph
only gives the merest hint of the
beauties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She described certain mountain and forest
views, also some parks and gardens she had
visited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you remember those lines in the
missionary hymn, Mr. Stokes,&rdquo; Miss Dora
asked,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;'Where every prospect pleases,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And only man is vile'?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Thurston told them that the people in
India do not live on farms as many do in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
country, but crowd together in towns and villages,
going out from there to work in the fields.
She briefly described the large city of Madras,
with its mingled riches and poverty, its streets
crowded with all sorts of people, some of them
with hardly any clothing on, its temples and
bazaars, or shops. Then she spoke of Madura,
where her home had been so long.</p>

<p>It was hard to get her listeners, as they sat in
this cool, shady garden, fanned by mountain
breezes, to understand how hot it is in India, especially
Southern India. They thought the <i>punkahs</i>,
or huge fans, that are in all the churches
and larger houses, and which a man works
constantly to cool the air, must be very queer
contrivances. The idea of having to stay indoors
during the middle of the day, keeping
very still, lying down, perhaps, did not strike
Mrs. Stokes very favorably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wouldn't suit me,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo; to lie
down in the daytime and be fanned. I'd want
to be up and doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear even your energy would flag in
that climate,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Thurston, laughing.
&ldquo;Foreigners are obliged to be very careful or
they could not live there at all. Of course we
missionaries were not idle at the time I speak
of. We were studying, writing, or making
arrangements about our work.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>She then told a good deal about the way the
missionaries work among the people, taking her
hearers with her in imagination to some of the
mission-schools, and to the Sunday services
in the little church where her husband had
preached. In doing this she repeated a passage
of Scripture and sang a hymn in the Tamil
language&mdash;the language used in that part of
India.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I will tell you something of zenana
visiting,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thurston,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;wont you
please first tell us exactly what a zenana is?&rdquo;
Ruth knew herself, but she was afraid some of
the others did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The word zenana,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Thurston,
&ldquo;strictly means women's apartment, but as it is
generally used by us it means the houses of
the high caste gentlemen, where their wives live
in great seclusion. These high caste women
very seldom go out, except occasionally to worship
at some temple. They live, as we would
say, at the back of the house, their windows
never facing the street. Sometimes they have
beautiful gardens and pleasant rooms, but often
it is just the other way. They have few visitors
and no male visitors at all, never seeing even
their own brothers. The low caste women,
though they lack many privileges the others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
have, yet have more freedom and are not
secluded in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd rather be low caste,&rdquo; said Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn't rather be either if you knew
all about it,&rdquo; said Miss Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In visiting the poorer people,&rdquo; Mrs. Thurston
went on to say, &ldquo;when I was seen to enter a
house the neighbors all around would flock in, so
that I could talk with several families at once.
But in visiting a zenana I only saw the inhabitants
of that one house. To be sure there was
generally quite a crowd of them, for the rich
gentlemen often have several wives. Then
there would be the daughters-in-law, for the
sons all bring their wives to their father's
house. Then all these ladies have female servants
to wait on them and who are constantly
present, so altogether there would be quite a
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they would be glad to see you,&rdquo;
suggested Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. They welcome any change, their
lives are so dull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they do with themselves all day
long?&rdquo; inquired Miss Fanny. &ldquo;I suppose they
don't work, as they have plenty of servants to
do everything for them. They don't shop or
market or visit. They have no lectures or concerts
to attend. They are not educated, at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
not many of them; and even if they could read,
they have no books. Oh, what a life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they do, Mrs. Thurston?&rdquo; Marty
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they look over their clothes and
jewels, spend a great deal of time every day in
being bathed in their luxurious way, and being
dressed. Then they lounge about, gossip, and
quarrel a good deal, I suspect. They are very
fond of hearing what is going on, and the servant
who brings them the most news is the
greatest favorite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that's the way so many women have
lived for centuries!&rdquo; sighed Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things are improving somewhat now,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Thurston. &ldquo;Education for women is very
much more thought of than in former years. A
great many girls are now allowed to attend the
Government and other schools, and many men
in these days are anxious to have their wives
educated. Some employ teachers to come to
their houses and teach the inmates. If only all
these women could receive a Christian education,
India would soon be a delightfully different
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do the missionaries get into these
zenanas?&rdquo; Ruth inquired. &ldquo;Do they go as
teachers or visitors or&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In some cases missionary ladies have gained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
admission by going to teach these shut-in ladies
fancy-work or something of the kind. Other
times they contrive to get introduced in some
way, going as visitors. But in every case they
aim to make their visit the means of carrying
the gospel to these women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they willing to have you talk on religious
subjects?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them are not. You know there is,
of course, as much diversity among them as
among any other women. But after they have
got used to our coming, and have examined our
clothes and asked us all sorts of questions, some
of them very childish ones, they generally listen
to what we wish to say and become interested in
the Bible and the story of the cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurston then spoke particularly of
some of the houses she used to visit, told about
the pretty little children and their pretty young
mothers, what they all did and said, in a way
that interested her hearers very much. She also
told how some of these friends of hers had received
the gospel message and were converted
to Christ. &ldquo;And if you only understood the
position of these people under this dreadful
caste system, you would see what difficulties they
have to contend with before they can come out
on the Lord's side,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it is our
duty and privilege to show them the right way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the way of life, and shall we not do all in our
power to send them the gospel? Those of them
who know about free and happy America are
looking to us for help. Did you ever hear some
verses called 'Work in the Zenana'? I can
repeat a couple of them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;'Do you see those dusky faces<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gazing dumbly to the West&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those dark eyes, so long despairing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now aglow with hope's unrest?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;'They are looking, waiting, longing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For deliverance and light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we not make haste to help them,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our poor sisters of the night?'&rdquo; <br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a great deal more talk about India,
Mrs. Thurston being besieged with questions,
until Ruth feared she would be worn out, and
said the meeting had better close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I like to talk about my dear India,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Thurston with a tearful smile; &ldquo;and if
it is any help to you all in your work, I am only
too willing to give you the help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have helped us ever so much,&rdquo; replied
Ruth, &ldquo;and we are very grateful. I'm sure we
shall always feel the greatest interest in that
wonderful old India, with its sore need of the
gospel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Almira, &ldquo;I feel now that every
cent of money we can scrape together should be
used for India.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately it is not the only needy
place in the world,&rdquo; said Miss Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;we must just work hard
and do all we can for heathen lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they sang several hymns, Hiram and
Hugh Campbell having carried Almira's melodeon
out to the garden, and closed by repeating
the Lord's prayer in concert.</p>

<p>During the singing Mrs. Stokes had slipped
away, and Mrs. Ashford and Ruth exchanged
smiling glances when they saw her standing by
the garden-gate as the friends passed out, insisting
that they should take some cookies and drop
cakes from a basket she held. She would not
hear of the hotel ladies getting into the carriage
until they had partaken of the sliced cake and
hot tea she had ready for them on the side
porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is the way you get around it, Mrs.
Stokes!&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Ruth,&rdquo; exclaimed the good woman,
&ldquo;don't you say a word. I a'n't going to have
these folks go back home all fagged out when a
cup of tea will do 'em good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is another perfectly elegant missionary
meeting,&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;I wonder if Edith and
the other girls are having as good a time as I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>COUSIN ALICE'S ZENANA WORK.</h3>

<p>Mr. Ashford came up to the farmhouse
about the first of September, and spent a week
before taking his family home. So Marty did
not arrive in time to be present at the first meeting
of the band, but on the third Saturday of
the month she was on hand with her budget of
news. She had much to hear as well as to tell,
and it would take a long time to relate all the
missionary experiences of those travelled Twigs.
Indeed for several weeks something new was
constantly coming up. It would be, &ldquo;O Miss
Agnes, I forgot to tell about such a thing.&rdquo; Or,
&ldquo;I just now remember what I heard at such a
place. May I tell it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edith had attended a grand missionary meeting
at the seaside, and Rosa had gone with her
mother and elder sister to a missionary convention,
where she saw and heard several missionaries
who were at home for rest, and also several
new ones who were going out soon. Others of
the girls had attended band meetings where
they were visiting, or had joined with other
young workers in holding meetings in hotels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and cottages. But no one had, like Marty, been
present at the forming of a band and helped it
start. Nor had they, like her, become well
acquainted with a real missionary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just had the nicest long talks with
her!&rdquo; said Marty, meaning of course Mrs. Thurston.
&ldquo;I could ask her anything I wanted, you
know. I even sat in her lap sometimes and
hugged her real hard; and she would pat me
and smooth my hair with the very same hands
that used to do things for the little girls in
India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How elegant it must have been to have a
missionary meeting in that pretty old garden,
and such a nice missionary there to tell you
things!&rdquo; said one of the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i>,&rdquo; replied Marty briefly but fervently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I could help start a band as
Marty did!&rdquo; exclaimed Daisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you have helped, though you may
not be there to see it start,&rdquo; said Miss Walsh.
&ldquo;Perhaps what you told those little girls from
Georgia about our band and missions in general
will bear good fruit, and there may be after a
while a brand-new band in that far-away Southern
town, that little Daisy helped to start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do hope so,&rdquo; said Daisy, smiling and
pressing her hands together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be nice to ask Marty's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
mountain band to write to our band and tell us
what they're doing, and we'll tell them what
we're doing,&rdquo; suggested Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo; cried some of the girls.</p>

<p>After a little talk the suggestion was adopted.
They all wanted Marty to be the one to write;
but she said, though of course she was going to
write to Evaline, she could not write a good
enough letter to be read at the band, and would
rather Mary Cresswell wrote. Miss Walsh decided
that would be the better way, as Mary was
so much older and more accustomed to writing.
It was too much to expect Marty to do.</p>

<p>So Mary wrote a very nice letter&mdash;the Twigs
were very proud of their bright secretary&mdash;inclosing
a note of introduction from Marty. In
course of time a reply was received from Almira
thanking them all for their kind interest in the
mountain band, and accepting the invitation to
enter into a correspondence. This correspondence
proved to be very pleasant and profitable
to both parties.</p>

<p>What pleased the Twigs particularly was
that Almira told them the mountain band was
very much indebted to one of their members,
and it was likely the band would not have been
formed that summer if it had not been for that
member's help. Of course she meant Marty.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed Marty had boasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
that she had done much towards getting the
band organized. She only told in her childish
way how it had come about, and the girls could
not help seeing she had given all the aid possible.</p>

<p>Some of the other girls heard from members
of bands they had met during the summer, and
in this way several suggestions of ways of doing
things were gathered up and acted upon. Miss
Walsh said the whole summer experience had
been very helpful.</p>

<p>One of Marty's earliest visits after her return
was paid to Jennie in company with Cousin
Alice. They found the invalid sitting up in the
comfortable rocking-chair, looking very much
better. She was overjoyed to see them and had
a great deal to say. She was so pleased that she
happened to be up, and insisted on showing
how she could take the three or four steps necessary
to get from the bed to the chair. She told
them the doctor said that after a while, if she
was very careful, she would be able to walk.
&ldquo;Not, of course, that skippy way you do,&rdquo; she
said to Marty, &ldquo;but to kind o' get along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also showed the crocheting she had
done, and it was really very well done. As she
seemed so much better, Miss Alice asked the
doctor if it would hurt her to study a little. He
said it would not, and Miss Alice undertook to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
teach her to read better, so that she could enjoy
reading to herself. Jennie was glad of the
chance to learn and made good progress, so that
by Christmas, when Marty and Edith gave her
the Bible they had talked of in the summer, she
could read it quite well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, after a while, when Jennie gets still
stronger,&rdquo; said Miss Alice one day at Mrs. Ashford's,
&ldquo;I will teach her something of arithmetic
and writing, because she will never be able to go
to school, and some knowledge of the kind will
be useful to her. I will teach her to sew nicely,
too, and when she is older she may be able to
earn her living, even if she is lame and delicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a good work you will be doing,
Alice,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Ashford, &ldquo;if you help a poor,
sickly, ignorant child to develop into an intelligent,
self-helpful, and I hope Christian woman.
Jennie will bless the day she first saw you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but she never would have seen me but
for you and Marty. In fact I don't think I
should have taken much interest in her if my
attention had not been attracted to her by
Marty's self-denying gift of that doll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I don't believe <i>I'd</i> have taken much
interest in her if it hadn't been for hearing
about the poor foreign children at the mission-band,&rdquo;
said Marty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything comes around to the mission-band
first or last, doesn't it?&rdquo; said Cousin Alice,
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty near everything,&rdquo; replied Marty seriously.
&ldquo;And then there's Jimmy Torrence,&rdquo;
she added presently. &ldquo;I don't believe I'd have
been willing to have my ulster pieced for his
sake if I hadn't been hearing about those other
forlorn children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was glad to see Jimmy looking so much
brighter and better. Though he did not know
he owed his country visit to her, he remembered
the cake she had given him and the kind words
she had more than once spoken to him, so he
often lingered on the stairs to see her as she
passed in and out of Mrs. Scott's room, always
greeting her with a bright smile.</p>

<p>One Sunday Mrs. Scott made him and his
next older sister as clean and respectable as possible,
and took them to church with her. The
result was, some of the ladies of the church came
around to see the Torrences, fitted the older
ones out with decent clothes, and gathered them
into the Sunday-school.</p>

<p>Soon after this, one afternoon Miss Alice came
into Mrs. Ashford's sitting-room, half laughing,
and exclaimed as she sank into a chair,
&ldquo;Oh, Marty, how you and your mission work
are getting me into business!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how?&rdquo; demanded Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, those Torrences!&rdquo; said Miss Alice, still
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about them? Do tell us,&rdquo; Marty
insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one day as I was going to see Jennie,
I saw the two little girls younger than Jimmy on
the stairs, and they did look so cold this kind of
weather in their ragged calico frocks, and not
much else on. So I just went home, got my old
blue flannel dress, bought a few yards of cotton
flannel, and took them to Mrs. Torrence to make
some comfortable clothes for those poor children.
And, Cousin Helen, will you believe it?
I found the woman didn't know the first thing
about cutting and making clothes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very strange,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford.
&ldquo;How has she been getting along all this time
with such a family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She depends on people giving her things,
and on buying cheap ready-made clothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very thriftless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I've heard it is the way so many
poor people do. A great many of those women
work in factories or shops before they are married,
and afterwards, too, sometimes, and they
have no time to learn to sew. When I found
out about Mrs. Torrence I thought I would
offer to show her how to cut and make those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
things. I thought doing that would be far
greater charity than making them for her would
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure she goes out washing now and
then, but she has time enough to sew other
days, as she only has those two little rooms
to take care of, and she hasn't been taking
much care of them evidently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they only had one room,&rdquo; said
Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have taken another now, as Mr. Torrence
has steady work. Father got him a place
in a livery stable, and he's not a drinking man,
so they ought to get along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how did Mrs. Torrence take your offer
of help?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not seem to like it at first. I suspect
she thought I ought to make the garments
myself. But after a while she came around
and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Your pleasant ways would make anybody
come around,&rdquo; exclaimed Marty warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the compliment,&rdquo; replied Miss
Alice, smiling. &ldquo;Well, the amount of it is I
have been giving her lessons, and she is really
beginning to do right well. The little tots look
a great deal more comfortable, and now I am
going to show her how to alter some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
clothes the Methodist Sunday-school ladies gave
her, so that she will have something decent to
wear herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are getting into business!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Ashford. &ldquo;It is certainly very
good of you to take all that trouble. And I
should imagine it is not the most comfortable
place in the world in which to give sewing or
any other kind of lessons. Now Mrs. Scott is
different. Her room is always as neat as a pin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Miss Alice, &ldquo;that reminds
me there's more to my story. These sewing
lessons are actually making Mrs. Torrence
cleaner and more tidy. The first day I went
the table was all cluttered up, and when she
cleaned it off for me to cut out on she looked
rather ashamed of its dinginess, and muttered
some excuse as she wiped it over with an old
cloth. The next day that table looked as if she
had been scrubbing it all night&mdash;it was so
startlingly clean. She had scrubbed a chair, too,
for me to sit on. Then I suppose she thought
the clean table and chair put the rest of the
room out of countenance, for on my next visit I
found the floor had been scrubbed and the windows
washed. When I told mother about it she
said the woman should be encouraged, and sent
her that striped rug that used to be in our dining-room,
you remember. It was to spread down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
before the stove. The result of that was the
old stove has been polished up within an inch of
its life. Yesterday I took to the children those
gay pictures that came last Christmas with the
Graphic, and tacked them on to the wall. Now
the next time I go I expect to see the walls
scoured or whitewashed or something,&rdquo; and Miss
Alice finished with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you keep on you will work quite a change
in their way of living,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's plenty of room yet for improvement,&rdquo;
replied her cousin; &ldquo;for although it must
be pretty hard for such a large family to live in
such a small space and be cleanly, still they
might try to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think the narrow space would be
bad enough without the dirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, things have been and are yet pretty
forlorn. But I am glad I have been able to effect
a little change for the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said I got you into it,&rdquo; said Marty,
&ldquo;and I don't see what I have to do with it, nor
what mission work has either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have told you that one reason I
thought of offering this help to Mrs. Torrence is
that it may perhaps give me an opportunity to
say something to her on religious subjects.
She takes no interest in such matters, never
goes to church, and only allows her children to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
go to Sunday-school for what people give them.
The Bible-reader of that district tells me that
Mrs. Torrence wont listen to her, wont let her
go into the room. She is a sullen, ill-natured
kind of woman&mdash;I mean Mrs. Torrence&mdash;and
hard to get at. So I thought I might possibly
get at her in this way, and your account of missionary
ladies going to zenanas to teach fancy-work
in order to get a chance to tell the women
of God and the Bible, put it into my head that I
might try something of the same kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is just the same,&rdquo; cried Marty, &ldquo;except
that it's altering and mending instead of
fancy-work. How curious it is that zenana work
away off in India should make you think of helping
a poor woman close by in Landis Court!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got Mrs. Torrence to listen to
you yet?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't ventured to say anything directly
to her yet, but I have been talking to the children
about the Sunday-school lesson, explaining
it to them and teaching them the Golden Text,
and their mother is obliged to hear, whether she
wants to or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just the way Mrs. Thurston says it
is in those zenanas,&rdquo; said Marty. &ldquo;Many of the
women at first don't care to listen to good reading
and teaching, and want to talk about all
sorts of other things, so the missionaries have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
work it in the best way they can, and after a
while the women get interested and want to
hear. It seems as if they couldn't get enough
Bible-reading and talk. Maybe that'll be the
way with Mrs. Torrence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will hope so,&rdquo; replied Cousin Alice.</p>

<h3>ROSA STEVENSON'S SISTER.</h3>

<p>As Christmas drew near Marty found herself
very busy, for besides some little presents
she was making for her &ldquo;own folks,&rdquo; she and
her mother set to work to mend some of her old
toys, to dress some new cheap dolls, and to make
a few picture-books of bright pretty cards pasted
on silesia and yellow muslin, for the little Torrences
and other poor children they knew of.</p>

<p>Edith, also, was engaged in the same way,
and the little girls often worked together.</p>

<p>Though they had received some money on
their birthdays, they concluded to wait until
Christmas to give Jennie her Bible, as everybody
appeared to think it would be a very
suitable Christmas gift for her. They got Mrs.
Ashford to go with them to buy it, and with her
aid succeeded in getting a very nice one, good
size, clear print, and pretty cover, for the money
they had set aside for the purpose.</p>

<p>Their mothers gave them permission to run
down the afternoon before Christmas to carry
the Bible to Jennie, as there would not possibly
be time to go Christmas day when there was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
much going on. They were to call and ask
Cousin Alice to go with them; but when they
stopped at her house they found she had already
gone over to Landis Court, but had left word for
them if they came to follow her.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Mrs. Scott's room they
found Miss Alice very busy indeed, hanging up
some wreaths of green and otherwise decorating
the room. She was hurrying to get it all in
order before Mrs. Scott returned from her work,
as it was to be a surprise to her. Jennie, sitting
in the rocking-chair with the doll in her arms,
was watching the operation with the greatest
interest, every now and then exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh,
that's splendid! What'll mother say to that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Marty and Edith appeared something
else seemed to occur to her, and turning from
the decorations she cried eagerly to them,
&ldquo;Oh, did you get&mdash;!&rdquo; and then glancing at
Miss Alice, covered her mouth with her hand,
laughed very much, but would not finish what
she had begun to say.</p>

<p>She nearly went wild over the beautiful Bible
and could hardly thank the givers enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can read it my own self too, 'cepting
of course the long words,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How
queer it'll be to be sitting up reading a chapter
to mother 'stead of her reading to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might read to her those Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
verses in Luke to-morrow that I read to you not
long ago,&rdquo; Miss Alice suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I will. Where are they, I wonder?&rdquo;
said Jennie.</p>

<p>Edith found the place, while Marty snipped
off a little bit of her blue hair-ribbon for a
mark.</p>

<p>Some cakes and fruit Mrs. Howell and Mrs.
Ashford sent Jennie were also highly appreciated.
They had also sent some small but
useful and pretty presents for her mother,
which Jennie was to have the pleasure of giving
to her. Thus they all tried to bring some
Christmas joy into the poor little girl's life.</p>

<p>When Marty and Edith went home they each
found a small parcel that Jimmy Torrence had
left for them. They contained nicely crocheted
bureau-covers for their dolls' houses, and were
marked in Miss Alice's handwriting, &ldquo;For Marty,
from Jennie,&rdquo; and &ldquo;For Edith, from Jennie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! this was the secret she had with Cousin
Alice,&rdquo; exclaimed Marty. &ldquo;Just look mamma!
isn't it a pretty cover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edith was equally pleased with hers, and Jennie
seemed much pleased with their hearty
thanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really believe she enjoyed making and
giving those little things more than any other
part of Christmas,&rdquo; said Miss Alice. &ldquo;I suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
it made her feel as if she was in the Christmas
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty never enjoyed any Christmas season so
much as this one, when she worked so hard to
give happiness to the poor. She had her temptations
to overcome, too; for when the stores were
filled with beautiful things that she would like
to buy for herself or her friends, it was very hard
to keep from entrenching on the money she had
saved up for a special Christmas missionary
offering. But her year's training in missionary
giving had not gone for nothing, and she was
able to make a missionary offering a part of her
Christmas celebration.</p>

<p>The members of the band had not forgotten
the talk they had had over Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;'s letter,
when they resolved to try very hard to double
their usual amount. The most of them were
trying, and the sum was &ldquo;rolling up,&rdquo; the treasurer
said. Whether or not they would succeed
in what they were aiming at, remained to be
seen, but Miss Walsh encouraged them by saying
that they would certainly come much nearer success
by making continual efforts than by making
no effort at all.</p>

<p>One morning when the holidays were over,
and the little girls were on their way to school,
Edith had a great piece of news to tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Rosa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Stevenson's grownup sister is going away next
month to be a missionary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Is</i> she really?&rdquo; exclaimed Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; going to Japan, and Miss Agnes has
asked her to come to the meeting next Saturday
and tell us about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The news spread, and the next Saturday
every one of the Twigs was there, gazing with
wide-open eyes at the fair young girl who was
going so far from home to carry the gospel to
her ignorant sisters. Sitting there with tearful
Rosa's hand clasped in hers, she told the girls
that when she was studying in college, God had
put it into her heart to carry the tidings of his
salvation to the people who knew him not. She
said that though it was very hard to leave home
and friends, she felt it was her duty and privilege
to go, and she was thankful that the way was
open for her.</p>

<p>Then she showed them on the map what city
she was going to, and told them something of
the school in which she was to teach. She promised
to write to the band some time, and in closing
she earnestly appealed to them to do all they
could for missions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even be ready to go yourself if God calls
you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I was a little girl in a
mission-band, saving up pennies and learning
about these foreign lands, I never thought that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
one day I should be going to teach the girls of
one of these countries and try to win them to
Christ. So there may be some among you whom
God will call to this work, and I hope none of
you will slight his call, but be ready to do his
will in this matter as in all others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marty was very deeply impressed by what
Miss Stevenson said. She thought it would be a
grand thing to go away off as a missionary. She
wondered if God would call her to go. She
hoped he would. Only she would not wish to go
to such a civilized country as Japan; the very
worst part of Africa or the wildest part of Asia
would be what she would choose.</p>

<p>Her mind was so full of the subject that she
did not want to talk about anything else, or to
talk at all, and was glad that Edith was going to
her aunt Julia's from the meeting, so she could
walk home alone. She concluded that as soon as
she reached home, she would go into her room
and pray that she might be a missionary. Then
she could not wait until she got home, and being
on a quiet street, she slipped behind a tree-box
and offered this little prayer: &ldquo;Dear Lord, if
missionaries are still needed by the time I grow
up, I pray thee let me be one. For Jesus Christ's
sake. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She walked in home very soberly for her,
and going directly to her mother, asked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mamma, should you like me to go away
over the seas and be a missionary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said her mother emphatically.
&ldquo;I should not like it at all. You mustn't think
of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if God calls me to go?&rdquo; said Marty, with
quivering lip.</p>

<p>It would be hard, after all, to leave this dear
home. She scarcely knew whether she wanted
her prayer answered or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Ashford,
drawing her on her lap.</p>

<p>Then Marty told all about the meeting, and
what she had been thinking, and how she had
prayed to be a missionary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to be one if God wants me to, but I
don't see how I <i>can</i> go away and leave you all,&rdquo;
she said, half crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her mother soothingly, seeing
she was trembling with excitement, &ldquo;we need
not talk about it yet. It will be a long time until
you are old enough or know enough to go. You
will have to go to school many years yet, and
then, perhaps, to college, for you know the better
missionaries are educated the more good they
can do. Then you must learn to make your own
clothes and take care of them, and it is well to
know a good deal about housekeeping also, for
missionaries have to know how to be independent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and be ready for any kind of life. You
would hardly be prepared to go before you are
twenty, anyway, and that is ten years yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine and a half,&rdquo; put in Marty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the meantime you can be doing as much
as possible for missions at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marty, wiping her eyes and looking
comforted, &ldquo;that's so. We needn't think of
my going away yet, and I s'pose the right way is
to do as Miss Agnes says. She says the best way
in mission work, as in everything else, is just to
do the nearest thing and do it as well as we possibly
can, and then be willing to let God lead us
along from one step to another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is certainly right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken some steps since Edith got me
started, haven't I? I've learned a good deal
about missions, and I find it a great deal easier
to give money regularly now than when I began.
Don't you remember how at first I either
wanted to give every cent I had or else not to
give anything? But I found out that wasn't the
best way to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashford,
&ldquo;you have been the means of some of the rest
of us taking steps. Seeing how well your systematic
giving is working, I have started in to
do the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>have</i> you, mamma?&rdquo; exclaimed Marty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
&ldquo;Are you going to have a box for tenths? How
delightful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not a box&mdash;my square Russia-leather
pocketbook. And not tenths exactly, but what
you call the New Testament way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just lovely!&rdquo; said Marty, caressing
her. &ldquo;I'm so glad. So we'll both be mission
workers the rest of our lives, wont we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With God's help, we will,&rdquo; replied her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And p'r'aps dear little Freddie will begin,
too, when he gets old enough. You know there
are boy bands. But where is Freddie? He was
here when I came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a high-pitched little voice from the
next room called, &ldquo;Whoop! Marty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is. I wonder what sort of a funny
place he's hiding in this time,&rdquo; said Marty,
laughing and running to see.</p>

<p>Freddie had taken one of his papa's large
handkerchiefs out of the lower drawer of the bureau,
and spreading it out over his head was
standing in the middle of the room, hiding.
How he laughed when Marty found him!</p>

<p>Soon after Mrs. Ashford and Marty began
studying the Bible with the help of the concordance,
they agreed that it would be pleasant to
read a chapter together every night before Marty
went to bed. Sometimes she was too sleepy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to read more than a few verses, but generally she
tried to get ready in good time so that she would
be wide enough awake to read a whole chapter,
unless it was a very long one.</p>

<p>They were reading in Luke's Gospel now,
but the evening of this day Marty said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, mayn't we read that chapter that
has in it, 'Here am I; send me'? Miss Stevenson
read that verse to us to-day when she was
talking about us going, any of us. Do you know
where it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can find it pretty easily,&rdquo; Mrs.
Ashford replied. &ldquo;I know it is in Isaiah. Here
it is&mdash;the sixth chapter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They read it, and the eighth verse coming to
Marty, she read slowly and reverently,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also I heard the voice of the Lord saying,
Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?
Then said I, Here am I; send me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After they had finished reading, she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that is a very hard chapter. The
only verses in it that I understand are this one
where it says, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
hosts,' and the eighth verse about 'Whom shall
I send?'&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;if you understand
those two, they will give you plenty to think of,
and when you are older you will be able to
understand more.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>After a moment's silence Marty said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were saying a while ago that I'd have
to go to school and learn a great deal before I
could be a missionary. I s'pose I'll have to
study the Bible a great deal too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. I didn't mention that particularly,
because I took it for granted you would
know that any one who undertakes to show
others the way of life must know the way herself,
and the Bible is the book that points out
that way. You remember Jesus says, 'Search
the Scriptures; they are they which testify of
me.'&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;But how am I ever to learn? Some people
seem to know just where everything is, all the
verses that explain other verses, and so on.
They can so easily find something in the Old
Testament that exactly fits into something in
the New Testament. I often wonder how they
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They love the Word of God, study it, and
pray over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to love it too,&rdquo; said Marty, pressing
her face against the open Bible on her mother's
knee. &ldquo;Whether I'm a missionary or not, I
want to be a Christian and do some work for the
Lord.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
